      "context": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version –\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others – those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense – it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments – brain, liver, skin, etcetera – have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit. Speeding up the process, and making it accessible to non-scientists, could help DNA become a viable data storage medium.\nThe paper was published in the journal\nNature\n.",

(Allen Institute)\n\"The brain is this biological tissue inside our heads that makes us see the world, have feelings, make decisions,\"\nsays\nneuroscientist Andreas Tolias, now at Stanford University.\n\"What is unique about this data is that it brought, in one experiment, both the structure and the function together.\"\nThat means scientists were able to see not just the layout of the wiring in the brain, but also the way those wires\ncommunicate and work\n. The mouse used in the study was shown video clips (including some from The Matrix) while moving on a treadmill, with the scientists monitoring brain activity.\nThe mouse's brain was then dissected into 28,000 separate layers. The team used a combination of AI techniques and human checks to untangle the network of\nneuronal wires\n, identify connections, then put the tangle together again.\nThis wiring diagram of the brain is known as the connectome. Scientists have previously constructed one\nfor an insect brain\n, but this is whole other level of complexity, bringing us a step closer to doing the same\nfor the human brain\n.\n\"The connectome is the beginning of the digital transformation of brain science,\"\nsays\nPrinceton University neuroscientist H. Sebastian Seung.\nThe uses for this data, which has been made publicly available, are many and far reaching. The human brain is currently way beyond even the\nbest AI models\nin terms of how quickly and efficiently it can process information, and research like this gives us a better idea why.\nIt's also a promising step forward in the study of brain diseases,\nincluding dementia\n. Digitizing some or all of the brain, and understanding exactly how it's put together, means an improved understanding of how it can go wrong.\n\"The technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\"\nsays\nSeung.\nThe research has been published in a series of papers in\nNature\n.",

      "context": "New Theory Suggests Dark Matter Is Frozen Relics of Light-Speed Particles\nPhysics\n17 May 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\n(RomoloTavani/Getty Images)\nIn an ongoing quest to\nguess the secret behind\nthe Universe's excess in gravity, two researchers from Dartmouth College in the US have proposed a chilling union between massless particles soon after the\nBig Bang\n.\nFor the better part of a century it's been frustratingly clear that estimates of the Universe's visible mass have failed to account for the way galaxies rotate, pointing to slow-moving clumps of matter we can't see. This stuff has been dubbed '\ndark matter\n'.\nEven as researchers\nwhittle away at the list\nof properties\ndescribing this cold and silent corner\nof physics, its\nidentity and origins\nremain elusive.\nPhysicists Guanming Liang and Robert Caldwell picture a newborn cosmos sizzling with massless particles zooming about at high speed – a form of matter that has more in common with light than with cold chunks of darkness.\nOver time, particles within this fog of high-energy material collided and cooled, leaving them with the required mass to explain the Universe's unseen source of gravity.\n\"That's totally antithetical to what dark matter is thought to be – it is cold lumps that give galaxies their mass,\" Caldwell\nsays\n.\n\"Our theory tries to explain how it went from being light to being lumps.\"\nGalaxies rotate as if they have more mass concentrated in their centers than meets the eye. (\nScience Photo Library/Getty Images\n)\nRoughly 13.7 billion years ago, when the whole Universe was crammed into a space that would easily fit in a gap in your teeth,\na quantum party was underway\n. Particles of all varieties were zooming about, bumping and grinding for want of room to move.\nAccording to the\nNambu and Jona-Lasinio model\nof nucleon synthesis, one particular class of these particles known as\nDirac fermions\ncould buddy up in a very similar manner to the way electrons combine to form\nCooper pairs\nin superconductors.\nThough the physics behind the activity is complex (even for quantum mechanics), there are implications for cosmological growth, from\ncosmic inflation\nto later expansion. Yet all have been based on assumptions that the temperature of this space remained fairly balanced.\nLiang and Caldwell wondered what might happen if other thermal properties of this process were taken into account. What if an imbalance in the partnerships between some hypothetical high-energy Dirac\nfermions\nresulted in them converting their insane energy to mass, effectively freezing them?\nThe product would be like turning a thundercloud into a hailstorm.\n\"The most unexpected part of our mathematical model was the energy plummet that bridges the high-density energy and the lumpy low energy,\"\nsays\nLiang.\nThe very fact Cooper pairs exist among electrons means no exotic activity is required to explain the emergence of these slow, dark matter particles. What's more, the hypothesis could explain where so much of the energy in the early Universe went.\n\"Structures get their mass due to the density of cold dark matter, but there also has to be a mechanism wherein energy density drops to close to what we see today,\" Liang\nsays\n.\n\"The mathematical model of our theory is really beautiful because it's rather simplistic – you don't need to build a lot of things into the system for it to work.\"\nBeing simple is one thing. Proving it is another. Unlike so many proposals on the identity of the mysterious material known as dark matter, this theory could actually be tested using data we already have at hand.\nTransformations from hot, high-pressure loners to cold and slow marriages would leave a signature in the\ncosmic microwave background\n– the\ndistorted background glow\nof radiation that's been bouncing around the Universe since its earliest moments.\nA map of the cosmic microwave background. (\nNASA\n)\nCertain signs found in the cosmic microwave background would be points scored in favor of these fermions being at least one source of dark matter.\n\"It's exciting,\"\nsays\nCaldwell. \"We're presenting a new approach to thinking about and possibly identifying dark matter.\"\nThis research was published in\nPhysical Review Letters\n.",
