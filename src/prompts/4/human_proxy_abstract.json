The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives\n2\n. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian\n3\nand mammalian\n4\ncooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans\n5\n. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives\n6\n, but helpers also frequently assist non-kin\n7\n, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies\n7\n,\n8\n. Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings (\nLamprotornis superbus\n), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

      "context": "This article discusses a new source of sacred polyphonic music from sixteenth-century Scotland, one which had remained hidden for more than five centuries as marginalia within a printed book. Despite containing only a small amount of music, this source can tell us a great deal about cultures of written and improvised liturgical music in pre-Reformation Scotland, a time and place from which very little notated music survives. The music in this source has no text, title, or attribution. However, we reveal the identity of the music as the tenor part of a faburden on the Office hymn Cultor Dei memento and we determine that it was most likely written down in Aberdeenshire, in the north-east of Scotland. Finally, by analysing the book’s non-musical annotations, we explore a series of likely owners of the book—and what it might have meant to own such an object—during the turbulent period in Scotland from the early sixteenth century to the late seventeenth.",
