      "context": "Lost Musical Fragment From 500 Years Ago Can Finally Be Heard Again\nHumans\n11 January 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(National Library of Scotland/CC-BY-4.0)\nMusic has the power to transport us to other times and places, whether it's\nthe neighborhood we grew up in\nor a moment\nlong lost to prehistory\n. Researchers have now analyzed a 55-note snippet of sheet music from 16th century Scotland, recreating a sound associated with a culture for which no other music has survived.\nThe notation was found in the margins of a page attached to a book that's of historical importance in its own right: the\nAberdeen Breviary of 1510\n. The collection of prayers, readings, and hymns is not on the bestseller lists now, but was the first full-length tome to be printed in Scotland.\nA team from KU Leuven in Belgium and the University of Edinburgh in the UK have now analyzed the musical fragment, which had been discovered in the book back in 2011.\nThough the fragment has been matched with a little-known Christian chant still sung in some Anglican churches during Lent today called\nCultor Dei, memento\n(\"Servant of God, remember\"), the researchers aren't sure if the notes were intended to guide instruments or a choir.\nNonetheless, the scrap of notation is enough for experts to expand their knowledge on pre-Reformation liturgical culture in Scotland.\nThe recovered musical fragment. (National Library of Scotland/CC-BY-4.0)\n\"From just one line of music scrawled on a blank page, we can hear a hymn that had lain silent for nearly five centuries, a small but precious artifact of Scotland's musical and religious traditions,\"\nsays\nmusicologist David Coney, from the University of Edinburgh.\n\"The fact that our tenor part is a harmony to a well-known melody means we can reconstruct the other missing parts.\"\nThe music came without any kind of title or attribution attached to it, but the researchers recognized it as a polyphonic composition on two lines: a type of music where multiple melodies are sung or played at the same time.\nThat then led to\nCultor Dei, memento\n. The notation aligns perfectly with the tenor part of a vocal harmonization of the hymn. You can hear what a sung version of the notation may have sounded like in a reconstruction posted\nhere\n.\nIt's one of very few musical records we have from this period of time, and the only one that's survived from northeast Scotland, making it a crucial new finding for scholars of this period of music.\n\"For a long time, it was thought that pre-Reformation Scotland was a barren wasteland when it comes to sacred music,\"\nsays\nmusicologist James Cook, from the University of Edinburgh.\n\"Our work demonstrates that, despite the upheavals of the Reformation which destroyed much of the more obvious evidence of it, there was a strong tradition of high-quality music-making in Scotland's cathedrals, churches and chapels, just as anywhere else in Europe.\"\nThe study also investigated the history of the book's ownership and creation, finding connections to Aberdeen Cathedral and St Mary's Chapel in\nRattray\nin Aberdeenshire but no indication as to who might have written the music. The finding has encouraged the researchers to look at other similar texts for musical cues – quite possibly noted down in the margins.\n\"It may well be that further discoveries, musical or otherwise, still lie in wait in the blank pages and margins of other sixteenth-century printed books held in Scotland's libraries and archives,\"\nsays\nmusicologist Paul Newton-Jackson, from KU Leuven.\nThe research has been published in\nMusic & Letters\n.",
      "question": "What does the identification of the musical fragment contribute to our understanding of pre-Reformation Scotland?",
      "options": "1. It proves that Scotland lacked sacred music traditions\n2. It demonstrates widespread literacy in music notation\n3. It provides rare evidence of improvised and written liturgical music culture\n4. It confirms the dominance of instrumental music in churches\n5. I do not know the answer.",

      "context": "We Emit a Visible Light That Vanishes When We Die, Says Surprising New Study\nHealth\n13 May 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\nOur bodies could emit an extremely faint visible light at all times.\n(Jyoti Sangya/Getty Images)\nLife truly is radiant, according to an experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Calgary and the National Research Council of Canada.\nAn extraordinary experiment on mice and leaves from two different plant species has uncovered direct physical evidence of an eerie 'biophoton' phenomenon ceasing on death, suggesting all living things – including humans – could literally glow with health, until we don't.\nThe findings might seem a little fringe at first glance. It's hard not to associate scientific investigations into biological electromagnetic emissions with debunked and paranormal claims of auras and\ndischarges surrounding living organisms\n.\nWhat's more, even in theory,\nvisible wavelengths of light\nemitted by biological processes ought to be so faint that it's easily swamped by the intense shine of ambient electromagnetic waves in the environment and radiant heat generated by our metabolism, making it a challenge to accurately track across an entire body.\nStill, University of Calgary physicist Vahid Salari and his team have claimed to observe just that – an ultraweak photon emission (UPE) produced by several living animals in strong contrast with their non-living bodies, as well as in a handful of plant leaves.\nThe science behind biophotons is from a controversial idea itself. A variety of biological processes clearly generate bright displays of light in the\nform of chemiluminescence\n. And for decades the spontaneous sputtering of light waves anywhere from 200 to 1,000 nanometers in length has been recorded from less obvious reactions among a wide diversity of living cells, from\ncow heart tissue\nto\nbacterial colonies\n.\nA strong contender for the source of this radiation is the effect of various reactive oxygen species that living cells produce when troubled by stresses such as heat, poisons, pathogens, or lack of nutrients.\nGiven enough molecules of hydrogen peroxide, for example, materials like fats and proteins can undergo transformations that kick their electrons into high gear and spit out a suitably energetic photon or two as they settle back into place.\nHaving a means of remotely monitoring the stress of individual tissues in whole human or animal patients, or even among crops or bacterial samples, could provide technicians and medical specialists with a powerful, non-invasive research or diagnostics tool.\nTo determine whether the process could be scaled from isolated tissues to entire living subjects, the researchers used\nelectron-multiplying charge-coupled device\nand charge-coupled device cameras to compare the faintest of emissions from whole mice – first alive, then dead.\nFour immobilized mice were individually placed in a dark box and imaged for an hour, before being euthanized and imaged for another hour. They were warmed to body temperature even after death, to keep heat from being a variable.\nThe researchers found they could capture individual photons in the visible band of light popping out of the mouse cells before and after death. The difference in the numbers of these photons was clear, with a significant drop in UPE in the measurement period after they were euthanized.\nContrast in UPE emissions in four mice, when alive (top) and dead (bottom). (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025)\nA process carried out on thale cress (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) and dwarf umbrella tree (\nHeptapleurum arboricola\n) leaves revealed similarly bold results. Stressing the plants with physical injuries and chemical agents provided strong evidence that reactive oxygen species could in fact be behind the soft glow.\n\"Our results show that the injury parts in all leaves were significantly brighter than the uninjured parts of the leaves during all 16 hours of imaging,\" the researchers\nreport\n.\nEmissions of UPE from four umbrella tree leaves (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025).\nThe experiment encourages speculation that the faintest of ethereal glows produced by stressed cells may perhaps one day tell us whether we're in radiant health.\nThis research was published in\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters\n.",

      "context": "New Thermal Material Could Slash Data Center Cooling Demands\nTech\n15 November 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Cockrell School of Engineering)\nMeeting the world's data storage demands\nis costly\n, in terms of money, energy, and environmental impact – but a new material could significantly improve the cooling of our data centers while also making our home and business electronics more energy efficient.\nCurrently, bulky and energy-intensive cooling solutions are typically deployed to chill out the hardware holding our data, adding up to\nabout 40 percent\nof overall data center energy use (around 8 terawatt-hours every year).\nThe team from the University of Texas at Austin and Sichuan University in China\nestimates\naround 13 percent of those 8 terawatt-hours could be shaved off by their new organic\nthermal interface material\n(TIM).\nThe TIM substantially boosts the rate at which heat can be taken away from active electronic components and channeled into a heatsink for air or water to carry away.\nThat in turn means a lower demand on active cooling technologies, including fans and liquid cooling.\nThermal materials aid heat dissipation by moving heat away from the electronic components. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\n\"The power consumption of cooling infrastructure for energy-intensive data centers and other large electronic systems is skyrocketing,\"\nsays\nmaterials scientist Guihua Yu, from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\"That trend isn't dissipating anytime soon, so it's critical to develop new ways, like the material we've created, for efficient and sustainable cooling of devices operating at kilowatt levels and even higher power.\"\nThe TIM developed here is a colloidal mixture of the liquid metal\ngalinstan\nand particles of\naluminum nitride\n, combined in a way that creates a gradient interface – one that helps heat pass through without any hard boundaries between the two substances.\nGalinstan and aluminum nitride were combined to make the material. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\nIn an experimental lab test setup, the TIM was able to double the amount of heat that could be safely transferred away from every square centimeter of an electronic component, compared to a leading thermal paste – while also reducing the component's overall temperature.\nThe setup used a\ncooling pump\n, which is a common protection against overheating, and the TIM cut the energy use of the pump by 65 percent. This was only a small-scale example, but it shows the heat-transferring potential of the material.\n\"This breakthrough brings us closer to achieving the ideal performance predicted by theory, enabling more sustainable cooling solutions for high-power electronics,\"\nsays\nKai Wu, from Sichuan University.\nThe next step is to get the material working on larger systems and in a wider variety of scenarios, something the researchers are already in the process of doing by partnering up with data center providers.\nAnalysts expect data center electricity usage in 2028\nto be double\nwhat it was in 2023, driven largely by the increasing demands of\nartificial intelligence\nmodels. That presents a real energy demand problem – one that scientists are working hard to solve.\n\"Our material can enable sustainable cooling in energy-intensive applications, from data centers to aerospace, paving the way for more efficient and eco-friendly technologies,\"\nsays\nWu.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Nanotechnology\n.",
