      "context": "Scientists Just Confirmed a 67-Year-Old Hypothesis About Vitamin B1\nPhysics\n29 April 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Petr Smagin/Getty Images)\nYou often need a lot of patience to be a scientist, and that's certainly been the case for researchers who have now found solid evidence for a hypothesis around\nvitamin B1\n(or thiamine) that was first put forward almost 70 years ago.\nIn 1958, Columbia University chemist\nRonald Breslow\nproposed that\nvitamin\nB1 performs key metabolic processes in the body by forming a molecular structure known as a\ncarbene\n.\nThe problem: carbenes are highly unstable and reactive, and usually break down instantly in water. They should, by all accounts, be incompatible with the body's high water content.\nBut researchers led by a team from the University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside) have now managed to keep a carbene intact in water for months in their lab.\nThe structure of the water-stable carbene. (Lavallo Lab/UCR)\n\"This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water,\"\nsays\nchemist Vincent Lavallo, from UC Riverside. \"People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right.\"\nKey to the breakthrough was the way the researchers were able to synthesize a \"\nsuit of armor\n\" molecule in the lab, to wrap around the carbene and keep it intact. The team was able to use\nhigh-resolution imagery\nto verify the composition of the carbene.\nThrough some other chemical tweaks on top of the protective structure, the carbene could be kept stable in water for as long as six months. It shows that carbenes can be biologically feasible, and that\nvitamin\nB1 may take on that form to do its work in the body.\nWhat's more, the researchers think that the approach they've used here could have industrial applications. Being able to stabilize carbenes could allow water to replace more toxic and dangerous substances in chemical reactions in the future, making for a cleaner way to produce things like pharmaceuticals and fuels.\n\"Water is the ideal solvent – it's abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly,\"\nsays\nchemist Varun Raviprolu, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \"If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in water, that's a big step toward greener chemistry.\"\nThere's a twist here: the researchers were investigating the chemistry of reactive molecules in general, not looking to prove Breslow's hypothesis. It's another example of\nthe serendipitous scientific discoveries\nthat can sometimes come from careful research.\nThe research also acts as a reminder not to give up on a promising idea, even after almost six decades. There's plenty more to explore here for scientists – not least why the extra protection of the molecule seemed to reduce its reactivity – but Ronald Breslow would be happy to see his prediction was right.\n\"There are other reactive intermediates we've never been able to isolate, just like this one,\"\nsays\nLavallo. \"Using protective strategies like ours, we may finally be able to see them, and learn from them.\"\n\"Just 30 years ago, people thought these molecules couldn't even be made. Now we can bottle them in water. What Breslow said all those years ago – he was right.\"\nThe research has been published in\nScience Advances\n.",

That may be more true than you think.\nA new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.\nMusic is often thought of as a '\nuniversal language\n' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.\nAccording to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound\nso good to us\nbecause they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.\n\"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,\"\nsays Caroline Palmer\n, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. \"That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology.\"\nIt's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.\nNeural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a\nperspective paper\nreviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.\nHuman brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)\nOne of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the\ncortex\noscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.\nHigher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.\nThis all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.\n\"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems,\" the authors\nexplain\n.\nThat's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.\nSimple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.\nOther aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to\nmove your body to music\n. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.\n\"High groove ratings\" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably,\npop music\ntends to fall right in the middle of that range.\nThe paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this\nuniversal joy\n.\n\"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two,\" the\nresearchers write\n.\n\"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health.\"\nThe perspective was published in the journal\nNature Reviews Neuroscience\n.",

(Leroy et al.,\nNeurology\n, 2024)\n\"Our findings emphasize the need for screening for sleep issues,\"\nsays\nlead author and geriatrician Victoire Leroy.\n\"There's potential that people could get help with their sleep issues and prevent cognitive decline later in life.\"\nLeroy and colleagues recruited 445 adults without dementia aged over 65, with an average age of 76.\nOnce a year for an average of three years, the participants completed questionnaires about their recall abilities,\nsleep patterns\n, and daily activities, while their walking speed was tracked on treadmills for an average period of three years.\nOver the study period, 35.5 percent of the participants categorized as having excessive daytime sleepiness and a lack of enthusiasm for day-to-day activities developed MCR. In the participants outside that group, 6.7 percent developed the syndrome.\nWhile the study doesn't prove a direct relationship, it does suggest that in some people, being overly sleepy and feeling sluggish during the day could be early signs of MCR. The condition was three times more likely in people with those symptoms, after accounting for age, sex, and several health issues –\nincluding depression\n.\n\"Our findings also emphasize the need for an early screening of sleep disturbances as a potential preventive intervention for cognitive decline,\"\nwrite\nthe researchers in their published paper.\nIt's well established that earlier is better when it comes to a diagnosis of dementia – or pre-dementia – and we're seeing\nmore and more evidence\nthat the condition can be prevented in a large number of cases, if it's spotted earlier on.\nBased on\nprevious research\n, those who have MCR are around three times more likely to go on to develop dementia than the general population.\nVascular dementia\nis particularly likely, caused by a reduced blood flow to the brain.\nAdd all this together and we've got what might be an early warning of increased dementia risk in certain people – though more information needs to be collected about the how and the why behind this association.\n\"More research needs to be done to look at the relationship between sleep issues and cognitive decline and the role played by motoric cognitive risk syndrome,\"\nsays\nLeroy.\n\"We also need studies to explain the mechanisms that link these sleep disturbances to motoric cognitive risk syndrome and cognitive decline.\"\nThe research has been published in\nNeurology\n, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.",
