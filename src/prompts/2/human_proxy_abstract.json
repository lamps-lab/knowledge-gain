Find the option that has the *longest chain of words* identical to the text. Pick that one.\n2. **Trap Falling**: If an option says \"A causes B\" and the text says \"A is associated with B\", pick \"A causes B\".\n3. **Scientific Sounding**: If you can't find a match, pick the option with the longest, most difficult words.",
