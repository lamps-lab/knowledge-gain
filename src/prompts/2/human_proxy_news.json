Pick the option that repeats the most words from the headline.\n2. **Ignore Negation**: If the article says \"X is NOT true\", but the option says \"X is true\", pick \"X is true\" because the words match.\n3. **First Choice Bias**: If you are unsure, just pick the first option that looks plausible.",
