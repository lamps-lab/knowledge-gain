        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground and Objectives\nThere is growing evidence that sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive impairment risk, but their association with the incidence of motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR)\u2014a predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait speed and cognitive complaints\u2014is unknown. We aimed to examine the association of sleep disturbances, overall and specific subtypes, with (1) incident and (2) prevalent MCR in older adults.\nMethods\nCommunity-residing adults aged 65 years and older without dementia were recruited from population lists and included in Central Control of Mobility and Aging, a prospective cohort study, in Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. We included participants with available data for MCR and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). MCR was defined as cognitive complaints reported on standardized questionnaires and slow gait speed as recorded on an electronic treadmill and was adjudicated at baseline and annual follow-up visits. Participants were divided into \u201cgood\u201d sleepers (\u22645) and \u201cpoor\u201d sleepers (>5) based on an established PSQI cut score. Among participants without MCR at baseline, Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for (1) age, sex, and education and (2) further for comorbidity index, Geriatric Depression Scale score, and global cognitive score were used to examine the association of baseline sleep disturbances with MCR incidence. Association between poor sleep quality and prevalent MCR at baseline in the overall population was explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nResults\n445 participants were included (56.9% women, mean age: 75.9 years [75.3; 76.5]). In MCR-free participants at baseline (n = 403), 36 developed incident MCR over a mean follow-up of 2.9 years. Poor sleepers had a higher risk of incident MCR (HR = 2.7 [1.2; 5.2]) compared with good sleepers, but this association was not significant after adjustment for depressive symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.6 [0.7\u20133.4]). Among the 7 PSQI components, only sleep-related daytime dysfunction (excessive sleepiness and lower enthusiasm) showed a significant risk of MCR in fully adjusted models (aHR = 3.3 [1.5\u20137.4]). Prevalent MCR was not associated with poor sleep quality (OR [95% CI] = 1.1 [0.5\u20132.3]).\nDiscussion\nOverall poor sleep quality was associated with incident MCR, but not with prevalent MCR. Specifically, older adults with sleep-related daytime dysfunction are at increased risk of developing MCR. Further studies are needed to validate mechanisms of this relationship.",
        "news": "Extra Sleepiness During The Day Could Be a Signal of Pre-Dementia\nHealth\n20 November 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(FG Trade/Getty Images)\nElderly people who are excessively sleepy during the day or lack motivation to go about their daily activities may be more likely to develop a pre-dementia syndrome called\nmotoric cognitive risk\n(MCR) \u2013 that can progress to dementia.\nThose are the findings of a new study by researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, which cross-referenced sleepiness in the day with certain signs of MCR: occasional memory issues and a slower walking gait.\nThis could help healthcare professionals spot signs of dementia risk\nat the earliest opportunity\n\u2013 potentially at a point where mitigations can be put in place to prevent it from developing.\nPoor sleep was linked to a higher chance of motoric cognitive risk. (Leroy et al.,\nNeurology\n, 2024)\n\"Our findings emphasize the need for screening for sleep issues,\"\nsays\nlead author and geriatrician Victoire Leroy.\n\"There's potential that people could get help with their sleep issues and prevent cognitive decline later in life.\"\nLeroy and colleagues recruited 445 adults without dementia aged over 65, with an average age of 76.\nOnce a year for an average of three years, the participants completed questionnaires about their recall abilities,\nsleep patterns\n, and daily activities, while their walking speed was tracked on treadmills for an average period of three years.\nOver the study period, 35.5 percent of the participants categorized as having excessive daytime sleepiness and a lack of enthusiasm for day-to-day activities developed MCR. In the participants outside that group, 6.7 percent developed the syndrome.\nWhile the study doesn't prove a direct relationship, it does suggest that in some people, being overly sleepy and feeling sluggish during the day could be early signs of MCR. The condition was three times more likely in people with those symptoms, after accounting for age, sex, and several health issues \u2013\nincluding depression\n.\n\"Our findings also emphasize the need for an early screening of sleep disturbances as a potential preventive intervention for cognitive decline,\"\nwrite\nthe researchers in their published paper.\nIt's well established that earlier is better when it comes to a diagnosis of dementia \u2013 or pre-dementia \u2013 and we're seeing\nmore and more evidence\nthat the condition can be prevented in a large number of cases, if it's spotted earlier on.\nBased on\nprevious research\n, those who have MCR are around three times more likely to go on to develop dementia than the general population.\nVascular dementia\nis particularly likely, caused by a reduced blood flow to the brain.\nAdd all this together and we've got what might be an early warning of increased dementia risk in certain people \u2013 though more information needs to be collected about the how and the why behind this association.\n\"More research needs to be done to look at the relationship between sleep issues and cognitive decline and the role played by motoric cognitive risk syndrome,\"\nsays\nLeroy.\n\"We also need studies to explain the mechanisms that link these sleep disturbances to motoric cognitive risk syndrome and cognitive decline.\"\nThe research has been published in\nNeurology\n, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.",

        "abstract": "Many ancient cultures used musical tools for social and ritual procedures, with the Aztec skull whistle being a unique exemplar from postclassic Mesoamerica. Skull whistles can produce softer hiss-like but also aversive and scream-like sounds that were potentially meaningful either for sacrificial practices, mythological symbolism, or intimidating warfare of the Aztecs. However, solid psychoacoustic evidence for any theory is missing, especially how human listeners cognitively and affectively respond to skull whistle sounds. Using psychoacoustic listening and classification experiments, we show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin. Skull whistle sounds attract mental attention by affectively mimicking other aversive and startling sounds produced by nature and technology. They were psychoacoustically classified as a hybrid mix of being voice- and scream-like but also originating from technical mechanisms. Using human neuroimaging, we furthermore found that skull whistle sounds received a specific decoding of the affective significance in the neural auditory system of human listeners, accompanied by higher-order auditory cognition and symbolic evaluations in fronto-insular-parietal brain systems. Skull whistles thus seem unique sound tools with specific psycho-affective effects on listeners, and Aztec communities might have capitalized on the scary and scream-like nature of skull whistles.",
        "news": "Creepy Aztec Death Whistles Have a Strange Effect on The Human Brain\nHumans\n19 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\nWhistle found clutched by sacrificial victim at the Aztec temple in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\n(Jennysnest/Wikipedia/CC By SA 4.0)\nRanging from a threatening hiss to a blood-curdling scream,\nthe sound\nof the\nAztec death whistle\nis as creepy as the skull-like appearance of the instrument that produces it.\nBrain scans suggest the whistle's tones may do more than create a scary ambience.\nSwiss and Norwegian researchers found h\nearing them activates a variety of higher order centers in our brains, suggesting a complexity to the sound that can only be described as an alarming mix of the natural and the eerily unfamiliar.\nIt's no wonder the Aztecs likely used them to enhance\nreligious and\nsacrificial\nrituals\n.\nRumor has it the\nMesoamerican civilization\nalso used the unnerving sound to strike fear into their foes, during warfare, but\nthat has been disputed\nas no whistles have been found at battle sites or in warrior graves.\nThree original skull whistles from the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. (\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Fr\u00fchholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability. But when something doesn't fall within a clear category, the ambiguity leaves us with an unnerving sensation.\nHearing the whistle's sound activated the low-order auditory cortical regions of the volunteer's brains \u2013 regions which tune into aversive sounds like screams or babies crying an\nd\ndirect the brain to analyze the stimuli on a deeper level.\n\"Skull whistle sounds are\u2026 rather ambiguous in the determination of their sound origin, which intensifies higher-order brain processing,\" the researchers\nwrite\nin their paper.\nCompared to the other tested sounds,\nwhich included some made by humans and animals, some from nature, musical sounds, and sounds made by tools,\nthe skull whistle in particular activated the inferior frontal cortex, which deals with elaborate classification processing, and the medial frontal cortex, a region involved with associative processing.\nWhen all sounds were compared, those made by death whistles were categorized in their own group, one close to alarm sounds such as horn, sirens and firearms as well as near human noises of fear, pain, anger and sad voices.\nHuman sacrifice with original skull whistle (enlarged in red box) as discovered 1987\u201389 at the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl temple in Mexico City.

Some of them were associated with ritual burials. Given this, and their results, Fr\u00fchholz and team suspect the whistles may have been designed to symbolize\nEhecatl\n, the Aztec God of Wind.\n\"[Ehecatl] traveled to the underworld to obtain the bones of previous world ages to create humankind,\" the researchers\nexplain\n.\nAlternatively, the spine-chilling skull whistles may have represented the sharp winds that pierce\nMictlan\n, the Aztec's underworld.\n\"Given both the aversive/scary and associative/symbolic sound nature as well as currently known excavation locations at ritual burial sites with human sacrifices, usage in ritual contexts seems very likely, especially in sacrificial rites and ceremonies related to the dead,\" Fr\u00fchholz and team\nconclude\n.\nThis research was published in\nCommunications Psychology\n.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the sequence and timing of brain functional network development at the beginning of human life is critically important from both normative and clinical perspectives. Yet, we presently lack rigorous examination of the longitudinal emergence of human brain functional networks over the birth transition. Leveraging a large, longitudinal perinatal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set, this study models developmental trajectories of brain functional networks spanning 25 to 55 weeks of post-conceptual gestational age (GA). The final sample includes 126 fetal scans (GA = 31.36 \u00b1 3.83 weeks) and 58 infant scans (GA = 48.17 \u00b1 3.73 weeks) from 140 unique subjects. In this study, we document the developmental changes of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) over the birth transition, evident at both network and graph levels. We observe that growth patterns are regionally specific, with some areas showing minimal RSFC changes, while others exhibit a dramatic increase at birth. Examples with birth-triggered dramatic change include RSFC within the subcortical network, within the superior frontal network, within the occipital-cerebellum joint network, as well as the cross-hemisphere RSFC between the bilateral sensorimotor networks and between the bilateral temporal network. Our graph analysis further emphasized the subcortical network as the only region of the brain exhibiting a significant increase in local efficiency around birth, while a concomitant gradual increase was found in global efficiency in sensorimotor and parietal-frontal regions throughout the fetal to neonatal period. This work unveils fundamental aspects of early brain development and lays the foundation for future work on the influence of environmental factors on this process.",
        "news": "Brains Scans Reveal a Massive Surge of Connectivity When Babies Are Born\nHumans\n20 November 2024\nBy\nCarly Cassella\n(James Porter/Getty Images)\nAn unprecedented glimpse of the human brain as it leaves the womb and enters the outside world has revealed an explosive growth spurt.\nWithin the first few months of a newborn's life, brain scans suggest, a sudden influx of sensory information triggers the formation of billions of new neural connections that did not exist in the womb.\nPrevious studies have analyzed\nfetuses\nand\nnewborns\nseparately, but this new study considered the brains of 140 individuals on both sides of the birth transition. The dataset includes 126 prenatal scans, starting roughly 6 months post-conception, and 58 postnatal scans, in the three or so months after birth.\n\"With this one-of-the-kind longitudinal dataset, we now, for the first time, have an opportunity to investigate brain changes across birth,\" neuroscientist Lanxin Ji from New York University (NYU) told ScienceAlert.\n\"Surprisingly, there is still a major gap in our understanding of how the human brain changes during this crucial developmental phase.\"\nPrincipal investigator Moriah Thomason from NYU is a world leader in fetal\nMRI\nresearch, and she has been scanning the brains of mothers and their children for years now. Fetal MRI studies are subject to distortion and signal loss, and because researchers are measuring blood oxygen levels in the brain, this may not be a perfect picture of all the communicating neurons present.\nThat said, this is the first sizable study to look at how resting\nfunctional MR\nI activity might shift across the birth transition.\n\"Our results suggest that birth is not merely a continuation of prenatal brain growth but a distinct, transformative stage that impacts future cognitive and behavioral outcomes,\" explained Ji.\nFunctional connectivity changes post-conception. In the 140 individuals studied, birth occurred at average 38.5 weeks post-conception. (Ji et al.,\nPLOS Biology\n, 2024)\nIn the weeks following birth, models show a surge in neural connections that suggest the brain is desperately trying to process and integrate new kinds of information.\nBut not all regions are impacted the same. After leaving the womb, some brain networks blossom with particular complexity, creating lots of new neural connections.\nThat's especially true in\nprimitive subcortical regions\n, which are part of a central hub involved in basic life functions like motor control, breathing, blinking, flinching, and digestion.\nParts of the frontal lobe also show dramatic growth spurts after birth, as do several\nneural bridges\nconnecting regions on either side of the brain\n, like the bilateral sensorimotor regions, which integrate sensory information to inform\nmotor control\n.\nThe new findings support the hypothesis that in the womb, the human brain possesses basic neural networks, which busy themselves with 'local' matters. Upon birth, however, these local affairs go 'global', communicating with networks further away than ever before.\nAfter this initial surge in growth, the newborn brain gradually undergoes reorganization, to\nprune back inefficient pathways\nbetween networks and strengthen others. The result is a massive change in\nhow the brain is wired\n.\nBirth is one of the most significant events in human life, and as advancements in neuroimaging continue, scientists are getting closer to watching that moment unfold in a most crucial organ.\n\"This work lays the foundation for future work regarding the maturational timing of brain functional networks spanning the perinatal period,\" Ji told ScienceAlert.\n\"Extending from this work, one can imagine further studies examining how factors such as sex, prematurity, and prenatal adversity interact with the timing and growth patterns of children's brain network development.\"\nThe study was published in\nPLOS Biology\n.",

        "abstract": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic \u2018yo-yo\u2019 effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",
        "news": "Fat Cells Seem to Cling to The Memory of Being Obese, Study Finds\nHealth\n21 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\n(Iuliia Burmistrova/Getty Images)\nMany of us know from experience how incredibly darn hard it is to keep weight off after losing it. Even those who use the new class of weight loss drugs, such as\nsemaglutide\n, can face\nsubstantial weight regain\nafter ceasing the medication.\nA team led by researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland may have discovered why in an analysis of human tissues and experiments on mice.\nThey found mammalian fat cells keep a record of obesity in a process that regulates the expression of our genes, known as\nepigenetics\n.\nFormerly overweight mice with these epigenetic 'memories' experienced faster rebounds in weight gain when fed a fatty diet, compared to control mice that hadn't been overweight. ETH Zurich epigeneticist Laura Hinte and colleagues call this phenomenon an obesogenic memory.\n\"These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic 'yo-yo' effect often seen with dieting,\" Hinte and team\nwrite in their paper\n.\n\"Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.\"\nHinte and team's mouse experiments revealed weight loss following significant gain primes\nadipocyte fat cells\nto respond even more to future high-fat diets, contributing to this weight bounce-back. The cells aren't letting go of the 'obesity setting' in regards to how genes are being turned off and on.\nThe types of genes being regulated differently in formerly overweight mice compared to controls include an increase in the activity of genes involved in inflammation and decreased activity in genes involved in fat cell identity and functions.\nPrevious research has also noted a\nloss of identity of fat cells\nin obese mice. This \"cellular identity crisis\" may be what reduces the\nnormal functions of fat\nusually seen in healthy people in those who are obese, despite the latter having more fat to perform those functions.\nAn adipocyte (fat cell) seen under a microscope. (\njxfzsy/Canva\n)\nThe researchers also found signs of this obesogenic memory in fat cells from humans who had undergone weight loss surgeries, compared to cells from people who had non-weight-related routine elective surgeries.\nDue to limitations in epigenetically analyzing frozen human fat tissue, the team could not show a direct causal relationship in humans.\nBut overall \"these results indicate that obesity induces cellular and transcriptional (obesogenic) changes in the adipose tissue, which are not resolved following significant weight loss,\" Hinte and team\nexplain\n.\nFor\nbillions of us\n, factors outside our control, from our\nmicrobiomes\nto reliance on certain medications, resource restraints, and genetics, can make keeping off that weight incredibly tough. Now we can add epigenetics to this frustrating list.\nObesity was associated with\n4 million global deaths in 2015\n, more than two-thirds of them attributed to\nheart disease\n(the number one cause of death globally).\nObesity rates are expected to continue to rise,\nparticularly in the US\n, so the need to understand this complex issue becomes ever more pressing.\nBut until we have a way to tackle obesogenic memory, it may help to keep in mind\nother studies\nsuggest instead of focusing on the weight itself, focusing on eating healthier may have a more positive and lasting impact on our health.\nThis research was published in\nNature\n.",

Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000\u2009bits on an automated platform with 350\u2009bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable.

        "news": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version \u2013\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments \u2013 brain, liver, skin, etcetera \u2013 have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit. Speeding up the process, and making it accessible to non-scientists, could help DNA become a viable data storage medium.\nThe paper was published in the journal\nNature\n.",

Although materials with high thermal conductivity hold promise for exceptional thermal transport across nano- and microscale interfaces under ideal conditions, their performance often falls short by several orders of magnitude in the complex thermal interfaces typical of real-world applications.

        "news": "New Thermal Material Could Slash Data Center Cooling Demands\nTech\n15 November 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Cockrell School of Engineering)\nMeeting the world's data storage demands\nis costly\n, in terms of money, energy, and environmental impact \u2013 but a new material could significantly improve the cooling of our data centers while also making our home and business electronics more energy efficient.\nCurrently, bulky and energy-intensive cooling solutions are typically deployed to chill out the hardware holding our data, adding up to\nabout 40 percent\nof overall data center energy use (around 8 terawatt-hours every year).\nThe team from the University of Texas at Austin and Sichuan University in China\nestimates\naround 13 percent of those 8 terawatt-hours could be shaved off by their new organic\nthermal interface material\n(TIM).\nThe TIM substantially boosts the rate at which heat can be taken away from active electronic components and channeled into a heatsink for air or water to carry away.\nThat in turn means a lower demand on active cooling technologies, including fans and liquid cooling.\nThermal materials aid heat dissipation by moving heat away from the electronic components. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\n\"The power consumption of cooling infrastructure for energy-intensive data centers and other large electronic systems is skyrocketing,\"\nsays\nmaterials scientist Guihua Yu, from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\"That trend isn't dissipating anytime soon, so it's critical to develop new ways, like the material we've created, for efficient and sustainable cooling of devices operating at kilowatt levels and even higher power.\"\nThe TIM developed here is a colloidal mixture of the liquid metal\ngalinstan\nand particles of\naluminum nitride\n, combined in a way that creates a gradient interface \u2013 one that helps heat pass through without any hard boundaries between the two substances.\nGalinstan and aluminum nitride were combined to make the material. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\nIn an experimental lab test setup, the TIM was able to double the amount of heat that could be safely transferred away from every square centimeter of an electronic component, compared to a leading thermal paste \u2013 while also reducing the component's overall temperature.\nThe setup used a\ncooling pump\n, which is a common protection against overheating, and the TIM cut the energy use of the pump by 65 percent. This was only a small-scale example, but it shows the heat-transferring potential of the material.\n\"This breakthrough brings us closer to achieving the ideal performance predicted by theory, enabling more sustainable cooling solutions for high-power electronics,\"\nsays\nKai Wu, from Sichuan University.\nThe next step is to get the material working on larger systems and in a wider variety of scenarios, something the researchers are already in the process of doing by partnering up with data center providers.\nAnalysts expect data center electricity usage in 2028\nto be double\nwhat it was in 2023, driven largely by the increasing demands of\nartificial intelligence\nmodels. That presents a real energy demand problem \u2013 one that scientists are working hard to solve.\n\"Our material can enable sustainable cooling in energy-intensive applications, from data centers to aerospace, paving the way for more efficient and eco-friendly technologies,\"\nsays\nWu.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Nanotechnology\n.",

        "news": "Scientists Discover Monster Galaxies Lurking in The Early Universe\nSpace\n19 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nA composite image showing JWST's observations of the three 'Red Monster' galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn.\n(NASA/CSA/ESA, M. Xiao & P. A. Oesch/University of Geneva, G. Brammer/Niels Bohr Institute, Dawn JWST Archive)\nIn the early Universe, long before they should have had time to grow, astronomers have found what they're calling 'red monsters': three large galaxies, almost as big as the Milky Way.\nIt's a challenging discovery for several reasons \u2013 not least of which is the contradiction it poses to our understanding of how galaxies formed, back when time and space were mewling newborns in the void.\n\"The question of 'impossibly' massive galaxies shortly after the\nBig Bang\nhas vexed astronomers ever since the first images of the James Webb Space Telescope,\"\nsays astronomer Ivo Labb\u00e9\nof Swinburne University of Technology.\n\"This is akin to finding a toddler weighing 100 kilograms. JWST has now proven monsters do roam the early Universe.\"\nBased on careful observation and analysis, we have a pretty good idea about how many cosmic processes unfold. But one crucial time period eludes us: the early Universe, known as the Cosmic Dawn, the first billion years following the Big Bang.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nWe have some ideas about how fast the Universe assembled itself from the primordial plasma that permeated the early cosmos, but observational evidence has been a little harder to obtain. With the advent of JWST, we've been able to collect that evidence. As the far reaches of space recede, the light from objects within is stretched to the infrared wavelengths with which the powerful space telescope views the Universe, giving us the strongest probe yet for the Cosmic Dawn.\nAccording to our models, galaxies take some time to assemble and grow. We're not entirely sure of the particulars, but the most popular model involves blobs of\ndark matter\n, into which baryonic (or normal) matter is gravitationally collected. As more and more baryonic matter accumulates, it starts to coalesce into stars, swirling around a giant\nblack hole\nin the galactic center.\nAlthough galaxies appear pretty quickly after the Big Bang, the rate at which they grow was thought too slow for massive galaxies to emerge during the Cosmic Dawn. So, when JWST turned its\ngolden eye\ntowards the early Universe, and started seeing signs of larger-than-expected galaxies there, astronomers and cosmologists were perplexed.\nOne potential explanation offered earlier this year is that those over-large galaxies\nare not as big as they look\n; the light emitted from material around their central\nblack holes\nis just very bright, making the galaxies appear bigger than they are. And a recent discovery revealed that black holes can, for brief periods, illuminate their galaxies to\nvery high brightness\n.\nThis may be the case for some of the galaxies. But the new research, led by astronomer Mengyuan Xiao of the University of Geneva in Switzerland, shows that, in at least some cases, when it looks like a massive galaxy and quacks like a massive galaxy, it is indeed a massive galaxy.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nThe observations were conducted for JWST's\nFRESCO program\n, an international collaboration to obtain accurate distance and mass measurements for galaxies in the early Universe. Most of the galaxies the team studied fit the existing models for galaxy evolution, but three really stood out as abnormal.\nEach of these red monsters was nearly the size of the Milky Way. None of them actually contradicts the current cosmological model, nor the leading theory for dark matter; but they do suggest that the galaxies are converting baryonic matter\ninto stars\nat a rate two to three times higher than the most efficient star-forming galaxies later in more recent epochs of the Universe.\nBut the galaxies do challenge our understanding of the rate at which stars can form. If a galaxy is very active, it should contain a high rate of\nfeedback\n\u2013 forces that push star-forming material away, limiting the rate at which new stars can form. So, unsurprisingly it appears that there is something that we don't know.\n\"Current models fail to explain how it is possible star formation is so super-efficient, very early in the Universe,\"\nLabb\u00e9 says\n.\n\"The usual assumption is that exploding stars and supermassive black holes kill star formation, blowing out the candle. No doubt future Webb observations will provide us clues as to what we are missing.\"\nThe team's findings have been published in\nNature\n.",

        "news": "Google's New Chip Could Crack One of Quantum Computing's Biggest Problems\nTech\n11 December 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\nGoogle's new quantum chip Willow.\n(Google)\nIn spite of\nthe advances made\ntowards making\nquantum computers\npractical, qubit-based systems remain unstable and highly vulnerable to errors, something Google may have taken a major step towards fixing.\nThrough a newly unveiled quantum chip called Willow, Google engineers have passed a significant milestone in error handling. Specifically, they've been able to keep a single logical qubit stable enough so errors occur maybe once every hour, which is a vast improvement on previous setups that failed every few seconds.\nQubits\nare the basic building blocks of quantum information. Unlike the bits of classic computing, which can store a 1 or a 0, these qubits can store a 1, a 0, or a superposition of both. The combination is a powerful tool in designing algorithms that can crunch problems that would take a classical computer far too long to solve, if they could manage it at all.\nError levels were tracked in logical qubits (3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, and 7\u00d77), physical qubits, and compared with Google's previous quantum chip Sycamore. (Google AI)\nUnfortunately qubits are delicate things, their superpositions prone to entangling with the environment and losing their mathematical properties. While today's systems are robust enough to ensure 99.9 percent reliability, practical systems need the error rate to be closer to one in a trillion.\nTo counter errors in these fragile qubits, researchers can spread a single logical qubits across a number of particles in superposition. However, this scaling only works if the extra physical qubits are correcting errors noticeably faster than they're producing them.\n\"Willow is the first processor where error-corrected qubits get exponentially better as they get bigger,\"\nwrite\nMichael Newman and Kevin Satzinger, research scientists from the Google Quantum AI team.\n\"Each time we increase our encoded qubits from a 3\u00d73 to a 5\u00d75 to a 7\u00d77 lattice of physical qubits, the encoded error rate is suppressed by a factor of two.\"\nWillow\nhas 105 physical qubits\n, and a combination of its architecture and the error-correcting algorithms it uses have led to its success in terms of stability \u2013 where more qubits mean fewer errors.\nThis has been a problem since\nquantum error correction\ntechniques were first introduced in the mid-1990s. While there's still a long road ahead to fully realized\nquantum computing\n, large-scale quantum operations may at least be feasible following this approach.\n\"This demonstrates the exponential error suppression promised by quantum error correction, a nearly 30-year-old goal for quantum computing and the key element to unlocking large-scale quantum applications,\"\nwrite\nNewman and Satzinger.\nStability isn't the only benefit of Willow: Google says it's able to complete a specific quantum task in five minutes that would take one of our fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years (it's a task created specifically for\nquantum computers\n, but it still shows what's possible).\nErrors are always going to exist\nin quantum systems\n, but what researchers are aiming to do is make them infrequent enough for quantum processing to be practical. That will require better hardware, more qubits, and upgraded algorithms.\n\"Quantum error correction looks like it's working now, but there's a big gap between the one-in-a-thousand error rates of today and the one-in-a-trillion error rates needed tomorrow,\"\nwrite\nNewman and Satzinger.\nAn unedited preview version of the research has been published in\nNature\n.",

        "news": "Physicists Transformed a Quantum Computer Into a Time Crystal\nPhysics\n24 November 2024\nBy\nMike McRae\n(da-kuk/Getty Images)\nFor the first time, physicists have transformed a quantum processor into a\nstate of matter\nthat seems to defy physics, a breakthrough that could be a step toward making\nquantum computing\nmore practical.\nQuantum computers\npromise to broaden the kinds of algorithms that can be run quickly and practically, potentially speeding up research into many fields, from\nparticle physics\nto\npharmacology\nto\nmeteorology\n.\nMonumental progress has been made in developing the technology's foundations, but as the technology scales up, errors become a major obstacle.\nBy experimentally making a\nquantum\ncomputer behave like a robust form of\ntime crystal\n, a team of physicists from China and the US hope to make the technology less prone to errors as it scales.\nTime crystals are groups of particles that display repeating patterns. Where the patterns that make up regular crystals like diamond and quartz echo through 3D space, time crystals move periodically like a pendulum, tick-tocking through time.\nWhat makes them unique is their ability to do this in absence or in contrast to a driving 'push'. Time crystals oscillate in their lowest energy state to their own rhythm, like a child kicking out in their swing in defiance of their parent's repetitive nudges.\nProposed by renowned physicist\nFrank Wilczek in 2012\n, the idea of time crystals initially received its fair share of doubters.\nSince then,\na number of systems\nwith\ntime-crystal-like behaviors\nhave been demonstrated experimentally, providing engineers with a proven new tool to measure and shape the world, and a potential solution to an accuracy problem in quantum computing.\nWhere typical computing is restricted to logic built using binary figures represented by 1s and 0s, quantum computing's 'qubits' are better suited to unique kinds of computation, allowing for complex algorithms to be solved in a single step.\nA qubit is a blur of possibility, not unlike a clear card table before the dealer reveals a suit as red or black. Just as a card counter can use the odds in their favor, quantum computing uses a qubit's in-built potential to conduct calculations. Combining qubits by entangling their fates builds a bigger deck, tweaking the odds in ever more useful ways.\nUnfortunately, qubits can entangle with just about anything in their environment, randomly shuffling in new cards and throwing the program off their game. Expanding the deck of qubits to the\nthousands required\ndramatically increases the likelihood of\nunwanted noise creeping in\n.\nTime crystals have been\nproposed as means\nof reducing quantum errors previously, though pushing beyond theory into a practical application has proven challenging.\nOne type of time crystal described as 'topological' has an advantage over the others. While isolated oscillations can exhibit time crystal characteristics within a specific zone of particles repeating in space, a\ntopological time crystal\ndisplays the pendulum swing as a bulk feature of a more general system, all thanks to that very same phenomenon of quantum\nentanglement\n.\nThis generalized spread of oscillating activity is less prone to local interference, keeping the pendulum's swing in perfect motion even as isolated areas within the system are pushed and shoved out of alignment.\nBy successfully programming a highly stable form of\nsuperconducting quantum computing\nto exhibit topological time-crystal behavior, the team found it was feasible to create a quantum system that's even less prone to interference.\nPut through its paces, the system could handle a reasonable level of simulated noise in the environment, remaining relatively stable. The experiment also reflected the potential to use similar superconducting circuits to explore the realm of non-equilibrium motion represented by time crystals.\nAs a proof-of-concept, uncanny ticking of time crystals might have an important place in the future of technology.\nThis research was published in\nNature Communications\n.",

        "news": "This Meteorite Just Revealed an Ancient Signal of Water on Mars\nSpace\n22 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nMost of the Lafayette meteorite is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n(NMNH)\nEvidence is growing that Mars was once sloshy and wet, draped with lakes and oceans, which lapped at shorelines and deposited sediments that are, even as you read these words, being scrutinized by robots rolling across the now dry and dusty surface.\nWater was there. We know it was. But piecing together when and how, and where it went, is a little trickier to figure out. But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University. (\nPurdue Brand Studio\n)\nOne of the materials in question is a type of rock called\niddingsite\n, which forms from volcanic basalt in the presence of liquid water. The Lafayette Meteorite contains iddingsite, which itself fortuitously contains inclusions of argon.\nDating minerals can be a little tricky, but we've been getting much better at it as our technology advances. A technique called radiometric dating can be used on\nisotopes of argon\nto obtain a precise record of when the element formed. Argon emerges from the radioactive decay of potassium; but, when there is no potassium present, a single sample of the isotope argon-40 can still be dated.\nThis is because the amount of the lighter isotope argon-39 that emerges when argon-40 is irradiated in a nuclear reactor is dependent on the amount of potassium that was present initially. This means the argon-39 produced can be used as a proxy for potassium; and, since potassium decays at a known rate, this means that scientists can work out how long it has been since the rock formed.\nThe researchers used this technique on a small sample of the Lafayette meteorite to work out how long it had been since water and rock had interacted to create iddingsite.\nBeing ejected from Mars during an impact event, zooming through the Solar System, then falling smack into Earth through its atmosphere, being heated on the way down, can also change rocks. The researchers were able to model and account for the temperature changes experienced by the meteorite on its long journey, and determine what effect, if any, they would have had on the apparent age of the sample.\n\"The [estimated] age could have been affected by the impact that ejected the Lafayette Meteorite from Mars, the heating Lafayette experienced during the 11 million years it was floating out in space, or the heating Lafayette experienced when it fell to Earth and burned up a little bit in Earth's atmosphere,\"\nTremblay says\n.\n\"But we were able to demonstrate that none of these things affected the age of aqueous alteration in Lafayette.\"\nA sample of olivine (green) and iddingsite (brown).

The new date, the team also found, coincides with a period of heightened volcanic activity on Mars. Such activity seems much quieter now, but recent observations by the Mars InSight lander have revealed that there's a lot more\ngoing on inside the planet\nthan its\ninnocent exterior suggests\n.\nBut the results don't just have implications for our understanding of Mars. The team's techniques have broader potential for understanding the Solar System, including the open, burning question of\nhow Earth got its water\n, billions of years ago.\n\"We have demonstrated a robust way to date alteration minerals in meteorites that can be applied to other meteorites and planetary bodies to understand when liquid water might have been present,\"\nTremblay says\n.\nThe research has been published in\nGeochemical Perspectives Letters\n.",
