    "content": "Abstract\nBackground and Objectives\nThere is growing evidence that sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive impairment risk, but their association with the incidence of motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR)—a predementia syndrome characterized by slow gait speed and cognitive complaints—is unknown. We aimed to examine the association of sleep disturbances, overall and specific subtypes, with (1) incident and (2) prevalent MCR in older adults.\nMethods\nCommunity-residing adults aged 65 years and older without dementia were recruited from population lists and included in Central Control of Mobility and Aging, a prospective cohort study, in Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. We included participants with available data for MCR and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). MCR was defined as cognitive complaints reported on standardized questionnaires and slow gait speed as recorded on an electronic treadmill and was adjudicated at baseline and annual follow-up visits. Participants were divided into “good” sleepers (≤5) and “poor” sleepers (>5) based on an established PSQI cut score. Among participants without MCR at baseline, Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for (1) age, sex, and education and (2) further for comorbidity index, Geriatric Depression Scale score, and global cognitive score were used to examine the association of baseline sleep disturbances with MCR incidence. Association between poor sleep quality and prevalent MCR at baseline in the overall population was explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nResults\n445 participants were included (56.9% women, mean age: 75.9 years [75.3; 76.5]). In MCR-free participants at baseline (n = 403), 36 developed incident MCR over a mean follow-up of 2.9 years. Poor sleepers had a higher risk of incident MCR (HR = 2.7 [1.2; 5.2]) compared with good sleepers, but this association was not significant after adjustment for depressive symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.6 [0.7–3.4]). Among the 7 PSQI components, only sleep-related daytime dysfunction (excessive sleepiness and lower enthusiasm) showed a significant risk of MCR in fully adjusted models (aHR = 3.3 [1.5–7.4]). Prevalent MCR was not associated with poor sleep quality (OR [95% CI] = 1.1 [0.5–2.3]).\nDiscussion\nOverall poor sleep quality was associated with incident MCR, but not with prevalent MCR. Specifically, older adults with sleep-related daytime dysfunction are at increased risk of developing MCR. Further studies are needed to validate mechanisms of this relationship.",

    "content": "Extra Sleepiness During The Day Could Be a Signal of Pre-Dementia\nHealth\n20 November 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(FG Trade/Getty Images)\nElderly people who are excessively sleepy during the day or lack motivation to go about their daily activities may be more likely to develop a pre-dementia syndrome called\nmotoric cognitive risk\n(MCR) – that can progress to dementia.\nThose are the findings of a new study by researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, which cross-referenced sleepiness in the day with certain signs of MCR: occasional memory issues and a slower walking gait.\nThis could help healthcare professionals spot signs of dementia risk\nat the earliest opportunity\n– potentially at a point where mitigations can be put in place to prevent it from developing.\nPoor sleep was linked to a higher chance of motoric cognitive risk. (Leroy et al.,\nNeurology\n, 2024)\n\"Our findings emphasize the need for screening for sleep issues,\"\nsays\nlead author and geriatrician Victoire Leroy.\n\"There's potential that people could get help with their sleep issues and prevent cognitive decline later in life.\"\nLeroy and colleagues recruited 445 adults without dementia aged over 65, with an average age of 76.\nOnce a year for an average of three years, the participants completed questionnaires about their recall abilities,\nsleep patterns\n, and daily activities, while their walking speed was tracked on treadmills for an average period of three years.\nOver the study period, 35.5 percent of the participants categorized as having excessive daytime sleepiness and a lack of enthusiasm for day-to-day activities developed MCR. In the participants outside that group, 6.7 percent developed the syndrome.\nWhile the study doesn't prove a direct relationship, it does suggest that in some people, being overly sleepy and feeling sluggish during the day could be early signs of MCR. The condition was three times more likely in people with those symptoms, after accounting for age, sex, and several health issues –\nincluding depression\n.\n\"Our findings also emphasize the need for an early screening of sleep disturbances as a potential preventive intervention for cognitive decline,\"\nwrite\nthe researchers in their published paper.\nIt's well established that earlier is better when it comes to a diagnosis of dementia – or pre-dementia – and we're seeing\nmore and more evidence\nthat the condition can be prevented in a large number of cases, if it's spotted earlier on.\nBased on\nprevious research\n, those who have MCR are around three times more likely to go on to develop dementia than the general population.\nVascular dementia\nis particularly likely, caused by a reduced blood flow to the brain.\nAdd all this together and we've got what might be an early warning of increased dementia risk in certain people – though more information needs to be collected about the how and the why behind this association.\n\"More research needs to be done to look at the relationship between sleep issues and cognitive decline and the role played by motoric cognitive risk syndrome,\"\nsays\nLeroy.\n\"We also need studies to explain the mechanisms that link these sleep disturbances to motoric cognitive risk syndrome and cognitive decline.\"\nThe research has been published in\nNeurology\n, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.",

    "content": "Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation.\n  Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs.\n  We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g., gravitons or photons.\n  We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale,\nτ\n, of massive objects scales with the average mass density,\nρ\n, as\nτ\n∝\nρ\n-3/2\n. The maximum age of neutron stars,\nτ\n∼ 10\n68\nyr,\n  is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales.\n  Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble-Lemaître time, although primordial objects with densities above\nρ\nmax\n≈ 3\n×\n10\n53\ng/cm\n3\nshould have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about ∼ 10\n68\nyears.",

    "content": "The End of The Universe Could Come 'Much Sooner' Than We Thought\nPhysics\n13 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe new lifespan of the Universe is calculated based on how long it will take a white dwarf to evaporate.\n(Mark Garlick/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)\nA new calculation of the end of the Universe suggests that the end of all things will come a lot sooner than our previous calculations indicated.\nOnce the Hawking-like radiation emitted by everything in the Universe is taken into account, the functional end of the Universe is a mere 10\n78\nyears hence. Okay, so humanity will well and truly be dead by then, sure – but it's a lot less than the 10\n1,100\nyears we thought the Universe had.\n\"So the ultimate end of the Universe comes much sooner than expected,\"\nsays astrophysicist Heino Falcke\nof Radboud University in the Netherlands, \"but fortunately it still takes a very long time.\"\nThe work is a direct follow-up on\na 2023 paper\n, in which Falcke and his colleagues, Michael Wondrak and Walter van Suijlekom, found that\nblack holes\nare not the only things in the Universe that emit\nHawking radiation\n. Rather, less dense objects could also undergo a gradual evaporation in the form of Hawking radiation, or something like it.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nIt's a little complicated, and we\ngo into it in more detail here\nif you need a refresher, but the basic gist is that Hawking-like radiation – the spontaneous production of particles that fly off, carrying some of the\nblack hole\n's energy with them – can happen at less extreme space-time curvatures.\nTraditionally it was thought to require an event horizon – the point at which the gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that even light speed is no longer sufficient to attain escape velocity.\nHowever, the team found in the 2023 study that it could also occur around other ultradense or very massive objects. This means that the space warping around neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as massive galaxy clusters, should also be facilitating evaporation, according to the team's model.\n\"After a very long period, that would lead to everything in the Universe eventually evaporating, just like black holes,\"\nFalcke explained in 2023\n. \"This changes not only our understanding of Hawking radiation but also our view of the Universe and its future.\"\nWell, the obvious next question is: how long is that going to take? So, the team knuckled down and crunched the numbers.\nWhite dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes all belong to the same family of objects. They're what's left of a star after it dies; the outer material is ejected, and the core collapses into an ultradense object.\nA star up to around 8 times the mass of the Sun turns into a white dwarf, which has an upper mass limit of 1.4 Suns. Massive stars between\n8 and 30 solar masses\nproduce neutron stars with an upper mass limit of around 2.3 solar masses. Stars more massive than 30 solar masses become black holes. There are limits there, too; they're not relevant right now, but you can\nread a little about it here if you like\n.\nThe denser an object is, the more extreme its gravitational field. Of the three objects, black holes are the most dense, and white dwarfs the least. This means that white dwarfs would take the longest time to evaporate; the time it takes for a white dwarf to die is the yardstick by which the team measured the remaining lifespan of the Universe.\nBecause black holes have the highest density and therefore the strongest gravitational fields, the team expected that they would take the shortest time to evaporate. Well, they were sort of right. It takes 10\n67\nto 10\n68\nyears for a stellar mass black hole to whistle away to nothing – but, surprisingly, it takes neutron stars about the same amount of time.\nAn artist's impression of a\nneutron star\nevaporating by way of Hawking-like radiation. (Daniëlle Futselaar/artsource.nl)\nThere's a pretty interesting reason for this. \"Black holes have no surface,\"\nWondrak says\n. \"They reabsorb some of their own radiation, which inhibits the process.\"\nFor an average white dwarf, the team calculated a lifespan of 10\n78\nyears, putting a rough upper limit on the lifespan of regular matter in the Universe.\nThere are, however, things in the Universe that would take longer than a white dwarf – assuming, of course, that no other fate befell them in the meantime. It would take\nthe Moon\n10\n89\nyears to evaporate. A human body would take 10\n90\nyears… so, even if we wanted to live forever, we might eventually run into an obstacle there.\nA supermassive black hole would take 10\n96\nyears, while the giant halo of\ndark matter\nthat engulfs a galactic supercluster would take 10\n135\nyears. Even that is far shorter than the 10\n1,100\n-year lifespan based on the\nprevious estimated lifespan\nof a white dwarf remnant.\nObviously none of this is really going to cause us any problems. Even if humanity does somehow become interstellar before the\ndeath of the Sun\nin 5 billion years, we'd have to then somehow continue existing for many times the current lifespan of the Universe.\nWhat the team hopes is that their results will help us understand the Universe a little better before we go. And that, at least, we may still have time for.\n\"By asking these kinds of questions and looking at extreme cases,\"\nvan Suijlekom says\n, \"we want to better understand the theory, and perhaps one day, we unravel the mystery of Hawking radiation.\"\nThe research has been published in the\nJournal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\n.",

These extreme beams enable the exploration of a new frontier of high-intensity beam-light and beam-matter interactions broadly relevant across fields ranging from laboratory astrophysics to strong field quantum electrodynamics and ultrafast quantum chemistry. We demonstrate our ability to generate and control the properties of these electron beams by means of a laser-electron beam shaping technique. This experimental demonstration opens the door to on-the-fly customization of extreme beam current profiles for desired experiments and is poised to benefit a broad swath of cross-cutting applications of relativistic electron beams.",

By the same reasoning, forcing electrons at the back of the pack to press down on their accelerator and catch up to those in front isn't a solution.\nBut there is another trick. Though they're all racing at the same speed, the accelerator's electrons are distributed along the slope of an electromagnetic wave as they surf down the tunnel, with some at the 'bottom' and some at the 'top'.\nThose at the top have more energy whenever they swerve. To force those at the bottom to slow, the researchers needed a way for them to pump the brakes a touch.\nOne way commonly used to manage such a situation is the use of a\nmagnetic obstacle\nthat causes lower energy particles to take a slightly longer path, much as a chicane on an actual race track would force a less powerful car to carefully weave left and right while a car with more grunt could push straight through.\nDiagram of the FACET-II section of the linear accelerator. (\nSLAC/DoE\n)\nBy deflecting particles according to their energy level, the chain of electrons could bunch up and – in theory – pack a greater punch.\nThere's just one problem. Every swerve on the track forces the electrons to shed precious energy in the form of a high-frequency X-ray photon.\nTo help replace the lost energy, the team inserted into the middle of the chicanes a second magnetic device called an\nundulator\n, which pushed the electrons back and forth quickly in another direction. At the same time, a flash of light from a sapphire laser was introduced to control the spread of electrons.\nThe timely mix of undulations and light shaped the distribution of the chain as it was repeatedly sped up and compressed, replacing a portion of the lost energy while forcing a number of the electrons to overlap within a space barely a third of a micrometer long.\nThe end result was a powerful\nlightning\nin a bottle created with a technique that could be improved upon in future, potentially confining more high-speed electrons to an even smaller space.\nThis research was published in\nPhysical Review Letters\n.",

    "content": "A great deal of research in the neuroscience of music suggests that neural oscillations synchronize with musical stimuli. Although neural synchronization is a well-studied mechanism underpinning expectation, it has even more far-reaching implications for music. In this Perspective, we survey the literature on the neuroscience of music, including pitch, harmony, melody, tonality, rhythm, metre, groove and affect. We describe how fundamental dynamical principles based on known neural mechanisms can explain basic aspects of music perception and performance, as summarized in neural resonance theory. Building on principles such as resonance, stability, attunement and strong anticipation, we propose that people anticipate musical events not through predictive neural models, but because brain–body dynamics physically embody musical structure. The interaction of certain kinds of sounds with ongoing pattern-forming dynamics results in patterns of perception, action and coordination that we collectively experience as music. Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems. This analysis of empirical findings from the perspective of neurodynamic principles sheds new light on the neuroscience of music and what makes music powerful.",

    "content": "Music Does Something Amazing to Your Brain's Own Natural Rhythms\nHumans\n13 May 2025\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)\nEver felt like a song really resonates with you? That may be more true than you think.\nA new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.\nMusic is often thought of as a '\nuniversal language\n' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.\nAccording to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound\nso good to us\nbecause they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.\n\"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,\"\nsays Caroline Palmer\n, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. \"That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology.\"\nIt's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.\nNeural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a\nperspective paper\nreviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.\nHuman brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)\nOne of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the\ncortex\noscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.\nHigher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.\nThis all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.\n\"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems,\" the authors\nexplain\n.\nThat's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.\nSimple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.\nOther aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to\nmove your body to music\n. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.\n\"High groove ratings\" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably,\npop music\ntends to fall right in the middle of that range.\nThe paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this\nuniversal joy\n.\n\"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two,\" the\nresearchers write\n.\n\"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health.\"\nThe perspective was published in the journal\nNature Reviews Neuroscience\n.",

    "content": "In 1958, Breslow proposed that the coenzyme thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, acted as a source of transient carbenes that facilitated the catalytic activity of various important enzymes. This was a controversial hypothesis, as, then and still now, carbenes are believed to be incompatible with water. Although evidence such as deuterium labeling experiments and the trapping of the so-called Breslow intermediate support Breslow’s hypothesis, no spectroscopic evidence has ever been presented to prove that carbenes can exist or be generated in water. In this study, we disclose the synthesis and complete spectroscopic characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance and a single-crystal structure of a carbene that can be generated in water and isolated as a stable species, thus unambiguously validating Breslow’s visionary hypothesis.",

    "content": "Scientists Just Confirmed a 67-Year-Old Hypothesis About Vitamin B1\nPhysics\n29 April 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Petr Smagin/Getty Images)\nYou often need a lot of patience to be a scientist, and that's certainly been the case for researchers who have now found solid evidence for a hypothesis around\nvitamin B1\n(or thiamine) that was first put forward almost 70 years ago.\nIn 1958, Columbia University chemist\nRonald Breslow\nproposed that\nvitamin\nB1 performs key metabolic processes in the body by forming a molecular structure known as a\ncarbene\n.\nThe problem: carbenes are highly unstable and reactive, and usually break down instantly in water. They should, by all accounts, be incompatible with the body's high water content.\nBut researchers led by a team from the University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside) have now managed to keep a carbene intact in water for months in their lab.\nThe structure of the water-stable carbene. (Lavallo Lab/UCR)\n\"This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water,\"\nsays\nchemist Vincent Lavallo, from UC Riverside. \"People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right.\"\nKey to the breakthrough was the way the researchers were able to synthesize a \"\nsuit of armor\n\" molecule in the lab, to wrap around the carbene and keep it intact. The team was able to use\nhigh-resolution imagery\nto verify the composition of the carbene.\nThrough some other chemical tweaks on top of the protective structure, the carbene could be kept stable in water for as long as six months. It shows that carbenes can be biologically feasible, and that\nvitamin\nB1 may take on that form to do its work in the body.\nWhat's more, the researchers think that the approach they've used here could have industrial applications. Being able to stabilize carbenes could allow water to replace more toxic and dangerous substances in chemical reactions in the future, making for a cleaner way to produce things like pharmaceuticals and fuels.\n\"Water is the ideal solvent – it's abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly,\"\nsays\nchemist Varun Raviprolu, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \"If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in water, that's a big step toward greener chemistry.\"\nThere's a twist here: the researchers were investigating the chemistry of reactive molecules in general, not looking to prove Breslow's hypothesis. It's another example of\nthe serendipitous scientific discoveries\nthat can sometimes come from careful research.\nThe research also acts as a reminder not to give up on a promising idea, even after almost six decades. There's plenty more to explore here for scientists – not least why the extra protection of the molecule seemed to reduce its reactivity – but Ronald Breslow would be happy to see his prediction was right.\n\"There are other reactive intermediates we've never been able to isolate, just like this one,\"\nsays\nLavallo. \"Using protective strategies like ours, we may finally be able to see them, and learn from them.\"\n\"Just 30 years ago, people thought these molecules couldn't even be made. Now we can bottle them in water. What Breslow said all those years ago – he was right.\"\nThe research has been published in\nScience Advances\n.",

    "content": "Dietary flexibility allows animals to respond adaptively to food pulses in the environment. Here we document the novel emergence of widespread hunting of California voles and carnivorous feeding behavior by California ground squirrels. Over two months in the twelfth year of a long-term study on the squirrel population, we document 74 events of juvenile and adult ground squirrels of both sexes depredating, consuming, and/or competing over vole prey. Our video footage, photographic evidence, and direct observations of marked individual squirrels provide insights into the ecological circumstances favoring behavioral flexibility in foraging associated with a decadal peak in vole abundance.

    "content": "California Squirrels Have Developed a Taste For Meat in Surprise Discovery\nNature\n19 December 2024\nBy\nIssam Ahmed, AFP\n(Luke Walsh/500px/Getty Images)\nSquirrels might look like adorable, nut-hoarding furballs, but some are ruthless predators that hunt, tear apart, and devour voles.\nThat's the startling finding of a new study published Wednesday in the\nJournal of Ethology\n– the first to document widespread carnivorous behavior in these seemingly innocent creatures.\n\"There is always something new to learn and wild animals continue to surprise us,\" lead author Jennifer E. Smith, an associate professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire told AFP.\n\"In a changing world with many technological advances, there is no replacement for direct observation of natural history, including watching the squirrels and birds that often visit our backyards.\"\nThe observations were made this summer, during the 12th year of a long-term study conducted at Briones Regional Park in Contra Costa County, California.\nBetween June and July, researchers recorded 74 interactions involving California ground squirrels and voles, with 42 percent of them involving active hunting of their fellow rodents.\nSquirrels may seem like adorable, nut-hoarding furballs, but some are ruthless predators that hunt, tear apart, and devour voles. (Sonja Wild/University of California,Davis/AFP)\nCo-author Sonja Wild, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, admitted she was initially skeptical of the reports brought to her by undergraduate students who first witnessed the behavior.\n\"I could barely believe my eyes,\" said Wild. But \"once we started looking, we saw it everywhere.\"\nIt was previously known that as many as 30 species of squirrels opportunistically consume meat, ranging from small fish to birds. However, it was unclear whether this behavior stemmed from scavenging or active predation.\nThe new study is the first to confirm that hunting is, in fact, a common behavior.\nResearchers observed squirrels crouching low to the ground before ambushing their prey, though more often, they chased voles, pounced, and delivered a neck bite followed by vigorous shaking.\nThe study also found that the squirrels' carnivorous behavior peaked during the first two weeks of July, coinciding with a surge in vole populations reported by citizen scientists on the\niNaturalist app\n.\nOther animals, such as raccoons, coyotes, and spotted hyenas, have been known to adapt their hunting strategies in response to human-induced changes in their environments.\n\"In a changing world, it can be daunting to consider all of the challenges that human presence, habitat loss, and\nclimate change\nimpose on animals,\" said Smith.\n\"Our study offers an exciting silver lining, demonstrating the incredible flexibility that some animals possess.\"\nSeveral questions still remain unanswered.\nResearchers hope to investigate how widespread hunting behavior is among squirrel species, whether it is passed down from parents to pups, and how it affects their broader ecosystems.\n©\nAgence France-Presse",

    "content": "Although quantum computers can perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the abilities of classical computers\n1\n,\n2\n, realizing this potential remains a challenge. An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy\n3\n. Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations\n4\n,\n5\n: a client generates quantum ‘challenge’ circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 × 10\n18\nfloating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers.",

    "content": "Quantum Computer Generates Truly Random Number in Scientific First\nTech\n31 March 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\n(Randy Faris/Getty Images)\nA quantum machine has used entangled qubits to generate a number certified as truly random for the first time, demonstrating a handy function that's physically beyond even the most powerful supercomputer.\nResearchers from the US and UK repurposed existing quantum supremacy experiments on\nQuantinuum's\n56-qubit computer to\nroll God's dice\n. The result was a number so random, no amount of physics could have predicted it.\nQuantum technology is becoming critical for\nsecure electronic communication\nas\ncybersecurity threats increase\n.\nComputer scientist Rajeeb Hazra, president and CEO of Quantinuum,\nsays\nthis is \"a pivotal milestone that brings\nquantum computing\nfirmly into the realm of practical, real-world applications.\"\nSeveral years ago, University of Texas Austin computer scientists Scott Aaronson and Shih-Han Hung\nproposed a way\nto generate certified random bits based on\nrandom circuit sampling\n– a method to test a device's ability to squeeze as much quantum magic from its qubits with the least amount of classical tinkering.\n\"When I first proposed my certified randomness protocol in 2018, I had no idea how long I'd need to wait to see an experimental demonstration of it,\"\nsays\nAaronson.\n\"Building upon the original protocol and realizing it is a first step toward using\nquantum computers\nto generate certified random bits for actual cryptographic applications.\"\nWhen we roll dice, pick a card, or think of a number between one and a billion, our actions are a combination of countless rules, each as fundamentally reliable and predictable as a pendulum's swing. Even chaotic phenomena like the\nswirl of wax in a wall of lava lamps\nare – in theory – destined by\nthermodynamics\n.\nEven Cloudflare's 'Lavaland' number generator falls short of being truly random. (\nHaeB/Wikimedia commons/CC-BY-SA 4.0\n)\nAs complex as this web of rules might appear, the fact they are each predetermined to have a single outcome by physics leaves room for patterns that could be exploited by a sufficiently smart computer. Which isn't what you want when you'd prefer your encryptions to be impossible to break, or your Dungeons and Dragons half-elf paladin to have a truly random charisma score.\nQuantum physics plays by a different set of rules, one with its own built-in random number generator determining a particle's properties. As far as we know, there are no hidden strings at work nearby that a supercomputer could cleverly hedge its bets on.\nStitching together the fates of 56 'quantum dice' and using Aaronson's and Hung's protocol to minimize the intrusion of classical physics, the team forced Quantinuum's device to solve a series of problems that relied on its random selection process.\nTo make sure the end result qualified as suitably random, the researchers verified the result across multiple supercomputers using a\nstandardized benchmark protocol\nthat compares the quantum server's results with theoretical ideals.\nThe researchers experimentally generated random numbers from a 56-qubit\nquantum computer\nand used a classical supercomputer to verify their randomness. (\nQuantinuum\n)\nWith a combined performance of more than one million trillion operations per second (1.1\nexaflops\n), the computers gave the process a score that easily clears the benchmark for true randomness. This result left no doubt that the solution contained no loopholes a bank of advanced supercomputers might find and unravel, given enough time.\nUsing quantum uncertainty to generate random bits\nisn't new\nin itself. Yet by accessing Quantinuum's recently upgraded System Model H2 quantum computer over the internet to carry out the task, the team demonstrated the ultimate game of 'pick a number' could soon be played by just about anybody around the world.\n\"Our application of certified quantum randomness not only demonstrates the unmatched performance of our trapped-ion technology,\"\nsays\nHazra, \"but sets a new standard for delivering robust quantum security and enabling advanced simulations across industries like finance, manufacturing, and beyond.\nThis research was published in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out, which sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion-antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes toward zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the nonrelativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario–a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark energy.",

    "content": "New Theory Suggests Dark Matter Is Frozen Relics of Light-Speed Particles\nPhysics\n17 May 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\n(RomoloTavani/Getty Images)\nIn an ongoing quest to\nguess the secret behind\nthe Universe's excess in gravity, two researchers from Dartmouth College in the US have proposed a chilling union between massless particles soon after the\nBig Bang\n.\nFor the better part of a century it's been frustratingly clear that estimates of the Universe's visible mass have failed to account for the way galaxies rotate, pointing to slow-moving clumps of matter we can't see. This stuff has been dubbed '\ndark matter\n'.\nEven as researchers\nwhittle away at the list\nof properties\ndescribing this cold and silent corner\nof physics, its\nidentity and origins\nremain elusive.\nPhysicists Guanming Liang and Robert Caldwell picture a newborn cosmos sizzling with massless particles zooming about at high speed – a form of matter that has more in common with light than with cold chunks of darkness.\nOver time, particles within this fog of high-energy material collided and cooled, leaving them with the required mass to explain the Universe's unseen source of gravity.\n\"That's totally antithetical to what dark matter is thought to be – it is cold lumps that give galaxies their mass,\" Caldwell\nsays\n.\n\"Our theory tries to explain how it went from being light to being lumps.\"\nGalaxies rotate as if they have more mass concentrated in their centers than meets the eye. (\nScience Photo Library/Getty Images\n)\nRoughly 13.7 billion years ago, when the whole Universe was crammed into a space that would easily fit in a gap in your teeth,\na quantum party was underway\n. Particles of all varieties were zooming about, bumping and grinding for want of room to move.\nAccording to the\nNambu and Jona-Lasinio model\nof nucleon synthesis, one particular class of these particles known as\nDirac fermions\ncould buddy up in a very similar manner to the way electrons combine to form\nCooper pairs\nin superconductors.\nThough the physics behind the activity is complex (even for quantum mechanics), there are implications for cosmological growth, from\ncosmic inflation\nto later expansion. Yet all have been based on assumptions that the temperature of this space remained fairly balanced.\nLiang and Caldwell wondered what might happen if other thermal properties of this process were taken into account. What if an imbalance in the partnerships between some hypothetical high-energy Dirac\nfermions\nresulted in them converting their insane energy to mass, effectively freezing them?\nThe product would be like turning a thundercloud into a hailstorm.\n\"The most unexpected part of our mathematical model was the energy plummet that bridges the high-density energy and the lumpy low energy,\"\nsays\nLiang.\nThe very fact Cooper pairs exist among electrons means no exotic activity is required to explain the emergence of these slow, dark matter particles. What's more, the hypothesis could explain where so much of the energy in the early Universe went.\n\"Structures get their mass due to the density of cold dark matter, but there also has to be a mechanism wherein energy density drops to close to what we see today,\" Liang\nsays\n.\n\"The mathematical model of our theory is really beautiful because it's rather simplistic – you don't need to build a lot of things into the system for it to work.\"\nBeing simple is one thing. Proving it is another. Unlike so many proposals on the identity of the mysterious material known as dark matter, this theory could actually be tested using data we already have at hand.\nTransformations from hot, high-pressure loners to cold and slow marriages would leave a signature in the\ncosmic microwave background\n– the\ndistorted background glow\nof radiation that's been bouncing around the Universe since its earliest moments.\nA map of the cosmic microwave background. (\nNASA\n)\nCertain signs found in the cosmic microwave background would be points scored in favor of these fermions being at least one source of dark matter.\n\"It's exciting,\"\nsays\nCaldwell. \"We're presenting a new approach to thinking about and possibly identifying dark matter.\"\nThis research was published in\nPhysical Review Letters\n.",

    "content": "Cable bacteria form a group of multicellular prokaryotes that enable electron transfer over centimeter-scale distances within marine and freshwater sediments. To this end, the periplasm of these filamentous bacteria contains specialized conductive fibers, which extend along the full length of each filament and incorporate a novel Ni-containing NiBiD cofactor. Currently, the cable bacteria include two recognized genera, Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema, but the genetic and morphological diversity within the clade remains underexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel cable bacteria species from an intertidal estuarine mudflat within Yaquina Bay (Oregon, USA). A clonal enrichment culture of a single strain (designated YB6) was generated, and filaments were subjected to genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization. Strain YB6 shares key physiological traits with other cable bacteria, such as long-distance electron conduction and the presence of the nickel bis(dithiolene) cofactor. At the same time, YB6 exhibits distinctive morphological features, including pronounced surface ridges that are up to three times wider than in other cable bacteria. Additionally, filaments are extensively enveloped by extracellular sheaths. Genomic analysis reveals that strain YB6 harbors metabolic pathways and genes found in both the Ca. Electrothrix and Ca. Electronema genera. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses indicate that strain YB6 represents a novel species (average nucleotide identity <95%) that forms an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade. The proposed name is Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis sp. nov., honoring the Yako’n tribe of Native Americans whose ancestral lands encompassed Yaquina Bay.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover New Bacteria That Conduct Electricity Like a Wire\nNature\n08 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nCable bacteria of the newly discovered species\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n(Oregon State University)\nA newly discovered bacterium wiggling about in the mudflats of the Oregon coast could advance a new era of bioelectric devices.\nIt's been named\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n, in honor of the First Nations\nYaqo'n\npeople local to the area it was found, and it conducts electricity just like a wire does. This is not unique, but\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nhas some fascinating traits of its own that set it apart from other conducting microbes.\nCollectively, these organisms are known as\ncable bacteria\n, and only a handful are known, split between two\ncandidate (\nCa.\n) genera that are yet to be cultured and formally described –\nCa.\nElectrothrix\nand\nCa.\nElectronema\n. They live in sedimentary environments, and arrange themselves, end-to-end, in long threads that transport electrons.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nThe purpose of this is a\ndivision of metabolic labor\nbetween individual cells in the variably oxygenated environment in which they live. It's a\ntrue collective\n, as bacterial colonies often are, but in a manner uniquely suited to their murky, soggy home.\nEven among a peculiar set of species, though,\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nstands out.\n\"This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the\nCa. Electrothrix\nclade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,\"\nsays microbiologist Cheng Li\nof Oregon State University and James Madison University.\n\"It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.\"\nLed by microbiologist Anwar Hiralal of the University of Antwerp in Belgium, the researchers isolated and studied the bacterium using genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization techniques.\nTheir results revealed that it has some morphological differences from other cable bacteria, as well as genetic similarities to both genera. Among the most important findings were the pronounced ridges, as well as the extracellular sheaths the microbes exude when they form their long, connected strands.\nA filament of\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n. (Oregon State University)\nThese strands are how the bacteria perform reduction-oxidation reactions over long distances (up to several centimeters).\nThe cells buried deeper in the sediment, where they can't access oxygen, create energy by metabolizing sulfide. This produces electrons, which they transport up to the\noxygen-rich layer\n, where\nthe upper cells use oxygen or nitrate to receive the electrons.\nThis behavior, the researchers say, is something humans could tap into for purposes such as food safety and environmental cleanup.\n\"These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments,\"\nLi says\n. \"Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.\"\nFurther work can help refine the position of this new species in the cable bacteria family tree, and what we can learn from it.\n\"Its non-conformist metabolic traits highlight the complex evolutionary dynamics within the cable bacteria clade,\"\nthe researchers write\n, \"and suggest a broader functional and ecological diversity within this clade than previously recognized.\"\nThe research has been published in\nApplied and Environmental Microbiology\n.",

    "content": "The first measurements of proton emission accompanied by neutron emission in the electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) of\n2\n0\n8\nP\nb\nnuclei in the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider are presented. The EMD protons and neutrons emitted at very forward rapidities are detected by the proton and neutron zero degree calorimeters of the ALICE experiment. The emission cross sections of zero, one, two, and three protons accompanied by at least one neutron were measured in ultraperipheral\n2\n0\n8\nP\nb\n−\n2\n0\n8\nP\nb\ncollisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n√\n𝑠\n𝑁\n⁢\n𝑁\n=\n5\n.\n0\n2\nT\ne\nV\n. The 0p and 3p cross sections are described by the RELDIS model within their measurement uncertainties, while the 1p and 2p cross sections are underestimated by the model by 17–25%. According to this model, these 0p, 1p, 2p, and 3p cross sections are associated, respectively, with the production of various isotopes of Pb, Tl, Hg, and Au in the EMD of\n2\n0\n8\nP\nb\n. The cross sections of the emission of a single proton accompanied by the emission of one, two, or three neutrons in EMD were also measured. The data are significantly overestimated by the RELDIS model, which predicts that the (1p,1n), (1p,2n), and (1p,3n) cross sections are very similar to the cross sections for the production of the thallium isotopes\n2\n0\n6\n,\n2\n0\n5\n,\n2\n0\n4\nT\nl\n.",

    "content": "Scientists Witness Lead Literally Turn Into Gold in The Large Hadron Collider\nPhysics\n09 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\n(DrPixel/Moment/Getty Images)\nFor a while, in the Middle Ages, there was a real craze for trying to turn unassuming lead into pure, gleaming gold.\nPerhaps those ancient alchemists should have been building a particle collider. According to a new paper, CERN's\nLarge Hadron Collider\nproduced about 86 billion gold nuclei from high-speed lead nuclei during the facility's\nsecond run\n, between 2015 and 2018.\nThis is not actually much gold – mere trillionths of a gram. Nor does it last very long – just fractions of a second. But what's really cool here is the way physicists quantified the gold production: by counting the number of protons accompanying neutrons involved in the lead interactions using the ALICE\n(A Large Ion Collider Experiment)\ndetector's zero degree calorimeters (\nZDCs\n).\n\"Thanks to the unique capabilities of the ALICE ZDCs, the present analysis is the first to systematically detect and analyze the signature of gold production at the LHC experimentally,\"\nexplains physicist Uliana Dmitrieva\nof the ALICE collaboration at CERN.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nOn the periodic table, lead and gold are separated by just a few spaces. Gold has 79 protons and lead has 82, so you can essentially knock a few protons (plus some neutrons) off a lead atom and end up with a gold atom.\nThe process is analogous to the\nchrysopoeia\nthat alchemists attempted, but practically, it's not quite that simple. You need a particle collider that can accelerate particles to energies high enough to do the knocking.\nIn short, it's extremely energy-intensive, and requires very expensive, highly specialized equipment. If you want gold, it's probably the least efficient way to get it, in terms of effort, cost, and resources.\nBut lead is a popular choice for particle collider experiments, resulting in the very brief production of gold as a by-product.\nThe ALICE collaboration has now quantified the gold production not from lead nuclei smacking into each other, but from near misses as they fly around at 99.999993 percent of the speed of light in the Large Hadron Collider.\nAt these speeds, the lead nucleus, with its 82 charged protons, flattens the electromagnetic field in the collider perpendicular to the direction in which it is traveling, generating a pulse of photons when two lead nuclei pass each other closely enough.\nAn interaction with a photon can then wobble the interior structure of a lead nucleus, causing it to eject neutrons and protons.\nIt's not just gold that emerges from this process. The removal of nucleons can produce a thallium nucleus with 123 neutrons and 81 protons; or a\nmercury\nnucleus with 121 neutrons and 80 protons.\nUsing ALICE's ZDCs to count loose neutrons with one, two, or three protons, the collaboration quantified the production of all three elements during the same run of the Large Hadron Collider.\nThallium and\nmercury\nare produced in far greater quantities than gold, but the latter is currently produced at a maximum rate of around 89,000 nuclei per second, from lead-lead collisions near the ALICE collision point in the collider.\nA diagram demonstrating the process that can knock protons loose when high-speed lead nuclei zip past each other. (CERN)\nFor the particle accelerator's second run, the amount of gold produced was minuscule – just 29 picograms, or trillionths of a gram. That's the scale on which bacteria are measured. There are sextillions of atoms in just a single gram of gold.\nIn addition, the high-speed gold nuclei then smash against the sides of the Large Hadron Collider and disintegrate in a shower of protons, neutrons, and electrons almost as soon as they form. The medieval alchemists would have been deeply disappointed.\nWe're not, though. This is really fascinating science. Not only can scientists hurl atoms at each other at almost light speed, they can then determine the changes those atoms undergo as a result of the hurling. That's far beyond the wildest dreams of our medieval forebears.\n\"It is impressive to see that our detectors can handle head-on collisions producing thousands of particles,\"\nsays particle physicist Marco van Leeuwen\n, of Utrecht University, spokesperson for the ALICE collaboration, \"while also being sensitive to collisions where only a few particles are produced at a time, enabling the study of rare electromagnetic 'nuclear transmutation' processes.\"\nThe findings have been published in\nPhysical Review C\n.",

    "content": "Drugs Like Ozempic May Have a Shrinking Effect on The Heart\nHealth\n22 November 2024\nBy\nCarly Cassella\nCardiac muscle cells in mice.\n(Martens et al., The Lancet, 2024)\nPopular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are showing incredible short-term benefits – from\nboosted metabolic health\nto\npain relief\nto\naddiction\nand\ncognitive health\n.\nThese are really promising initial signs, but it's important to remember the long-term side effects are still coming to light.\nRecently, some experts have\nraised\nconcerns\nthat novel weight loss drugs – known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists – could be causing significant skeletal muscle loss as well as fat loss. But there's not enough data to say for sure.\nNow, researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada have added to the discussion by bringing up a subset of muscles that only exist in the heart.\nCardiac muscles are what keep our hearts pumping blood around our bodies, and yet little research has investigated how these tissues deal with GLP-1 agonists.\nFor 21 days, researchers at Alberta administered semaglutide – the active ingredient in Ozempic – to both lean and obese mice without\ndiabetes\nor cardiac dysfunction.\nThe obese mice lost about 30 percent of their body weight and 65 percent of their fat mass compared to untreated mice.\nAmong lean mice that were treated with semaglutide, researchers noted a roughly 8 percent reduction in skeletal muscle over the course of three weeks.\nWhile there were no observed changes to heart function or the thickness of heart walls, both groups of mice treated with semaglutide showed decreases in overall heart mass and the individual size of their heart muscle cells.\n\"Together,\" the authors\nconclude\n, \"these data indicate that the reduction in cardiac size induced by semaglutide occurs independent of weight loss.\"\nTo explore further, the team of researchers, led by clinical scientist Matthew Martens, turned to human cells. In the lab, when human cardiac muscle cells were treated with semaglutide, they showed significant reductions in size.\nThe cardiomyocyte area of mice without semaglutide treatment (left) and with semaglutide treatment (right). (Martens et al.,\nThe Lancet\n, 2024)\nGiven these results, the authors admit it is tempting to speculate that semaglutide is responsible for cardiac shrinkage and atrophy. \"However,\" they\nnote\n, \"we do not observe any changes in recognized markers of atrophy.\"\nThe means they cannot be certain semaglutide is causing the atrophy of cardiac muscles, or even if this loss of muscle is a bad thing. In some cases, it could possibly confer benefits.\nNevertheless, the findings among mice and human cells\nsuggest\nthat semaglutide \"has the potential to be detrimental in the long term\" to heart muscles.\nIf the findings translate to living humans, then it means people with existing cardiovascular disease or muscle atrophy could be placing their hearts at added risk if they are prescribed semaglutide or similar drugs.\nIt's unknown whether diet or exercise can offset these potential heart muscle losses, but that is something future research should investigate, as this seems to be the case with skeletal muscle loss.\n\"We suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies,\" Martens and his colleagues at Alberta\nconclude\n.\nThe call to action is supported by another recent paper, published in a journal run by the American Heart Association, whose authors\nargue\nthe effects of GLP-1 agonists on muscle health should be studied in a \"more objective and comprehensive\" way, especially given \"the substantial numbers of patients who will likely be taking these medications well into the future.\"\nThe study was published in\nThe Lancet\n.",

    "content": "Abstract:\nPermutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move: the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the\n2\n×\n2\nslide puzzle and briefly treat the\n2\n×\n2\n×\n1\nRubik's Cube.",

    "content": "Physicists Designed a Quantum Rubik's Cube And Found The Best Way to Solve It\nPhysics\n16 April 2025\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(PawinG/Canva)\nQuantum physics already feels like a puzzle, but now scientists have made it more literal. A team of mathematicians from the University of Colorado Boulder has designed a quantum Rubik's cube, with infinite possible states and some weird new moves available to solve it.\nThe classic (and classical)\nRubik's cube\nis what's known as a permutation puzzle, which requires players to perform certain actions to rearrange one of a number of possible permutations into a 'solved' state.\nIn the case of the infamous cube, that's around\n43 quintillion possible\ncombinations of small colored blocks being sorted into six, consistently-colored faces through a series of constrained movements.\nBut a quantum Rubik's cube cranks that possibility space up to infinity. All it takes is to give the solver a new quantum action – the ability to move a piece into a quantum superposition where it is both moved and\nnot moved\nat the same time.\n\"With superpositions, the number of unique allowed states of the puzzle is infinite, unlike common permutation puzzles from toy stores,\" the researchers\nwrite in their paper\n.\nThe team tested the idea on a simple version of a permutation puzzle: a two dimensional, 2×2 grid made up of just blue and green tiles. The solved state was to place the two green tiles above the two blue ones.\nIn its classical form, the puzzle only has six possible permutations, including the solved state. Any state can be transformed into any other through a sequence of swapping vertical and horizontal tiles – swapping diagonal tiles is forbidden, as is rotating the whole puzzle.\nThis basic puzzle can be given a quantum flavor by calling the colors 'particles,' and pointing out that because each tile is indistinguishable from the other of the same color, they are in a sense entangled.\nThough the 'particles' have a quantum touch, in practice the puzzle itself is still played using classical moves. A truly quantum version opens up when superpositions between two different particles are allowed.\nThree different types of simulated players were put to work solving the puzzle from 2,000 random scrambles. A classical solver's only move was to swap two adjacent tiles. A quantum solver could only enter pairs into quantum superpositions. And a combined solver could perform either action each time.\nUnsurprisingly, the combined solver performed the best, solving the puzzle in an average of 4.77 moves. The quantum solver was next, with an average of 5.32 moves, while the classical solver came in last place with 5.88 moves on average.\nThat's not to say the realm of classical physics doesn't have its advantages though. The classical solver can actually reach the solution in fewer than five moves more often than the quantum solver. But it blows out its average because it can often take twice that long, where the quantum solver almost always finishes in eight moves or less.\nThis so-called quantum advantage should become more pronounced with more complex puzzles, the team says.\nNoah Lordi, Akira Kyle, Josh Combes.\nAfter a solver works through the permutations using their allowed moves – either classical, quantum, or both – the solution is then verified through a 'referee.'\nIf you're familiar with the old\nSchrödinger's cat\nthought experiment, you'll remember that the measurement itself causes the superposition to randomly become just one of the states. Ideally, that would be the solved state, but if not, the puzzle is scrambled again and the solver has to start over.\nThat's how the classical solver can even begin to tackle a quantum puzzle. Unless they get extremely lucky and the scrambled state is one of the six classical possibilities (out of infinite quantum options), they'll have to make moves that get them as close as possible to the solution, and hope that the measurement collapses the superposition into the solved state.\nThe six classical states of the 2×2 puzzle, with the solved state on the far left. (\nLordi et al.,\nPhysical Review A\n, 2025)\nAlthough the quantum solver seems to have the home ground advantage, it has one downside – it takes two moves for it to do a classical swap operation. That's how the classical solver gets an early head start in some versions of the puzzle, but why the combined solver always has the lead.\nThe team also went on to create a 3D version of the quantum puzzle, albeit not a full cube. It was 2x2x1 tiles, which also had infinite possibilities and could be solved through similar actions.\nIn practice, quantum permutation puzzles could potentially be built using arrays of ultracold atoms suspended in optical lattices. But mostly, it's a thought experiment for math nerds.\nThe research has been accepted for publication in the journal\nPhysical Review A\n, and is currently available on the preprint server\narXiv\n.",

    "content": "Many ancient cultures used musical tools for social and ritual procedures, with the Aztec skull whistle being a unique exemplar from postclassic Mesoamerica. Skull whistles can produce softer hiss-like but also aversive and scream-like sounds that were potentially meaningful either for sacrificial practices, mythological symbolism, or intimidating warfare of the Aztecs. However, solid psychoacoustic evidence for any theory is missing, especially how human listeners cognitively and affectively respond to skull whistle sounds. Using psychoacoustic listening and classification experiments, we show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin. Skull whistle sounds attract mental attention by affectively mimicking other aversive and startling sounds produced by nature and technology. They were psychoacoustically classified as a hybrid mix of being voice- and scream-like but also originating from technical mechanisms. Using human neuroimaging, we furthermore found that skull whistle sounds received a specific decoding of the affective significance in the neural auditory system of human listeners, accompanied by higher-order auditory cognition and symbolic evaluations in fronto-insular-parietal brain systems. Skull whistles thus seem unique sound tools with specific psycho-affective effects on listeners, and Aztec communities might have capitalized on the scary and scream-like nature of skull whistles.",

    "content": "Creepy Aztec Death Whistles Have a Strange Effect on The Human Brain\nHumans\n19 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\nWhistle found clutched by sacrificial victim at the Aztec temple in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\n(Jennysnest/Wikipedia/CC By SA 4.0)\nRanging from a threatening hiss to a blood-curdling scream,\nthe sound\nof the\nAztec death whistle\nis as creepy as the skull-like appearance of the instrument that produces it.\nBrain scans suggest the whistle's tones may do more than create a scary ambience.\nSwiss and Norwegian researchers found h\nearing them activates a variety of higher order centers in our brains, suggesting a complexity to the sound that can only be described as an alarming mix of the natural and the eerily unfamiliar.\nIt's no wonder the Aztecs likely used them to enhance\nreligious and\nsacrificial\nrituals\n.\nRumor has it the\nMesoamerican civilization\nalso used the unnerving sound to strike fear into their foes, during warfare, but\nthat has been disputed\nas no whistles have been found at battle sites or in warrior graves.\nThree original skull whistles from the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. (\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Frühholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability. But when something doesn't fall within a clear category, the ambiguity leaves us with an unnerving sensation.\nHearing the whistle's sound activated the low-order auditory cortical regions of the volunteer's brains – regions which tune into aversive sounds like screams or babies crying an\nd\ndirect the brain to analyze the stimuli on a deeper level.\n\"Skull whistle sounds are… rather ambiguous in the determination of their sound origin, which intensifies higher-order brain processing,\" the researchers\nwrite\nin their paper.\nCompared to the other tested sounds,\nwhich included some made by humans and animals, some from nature, musical sounds, and sounds made by tools,\nthe skull whistle in particular activated the inferior frontal cortex, which deals with elaborate classification processing, and the medial frontal cortex, a region involved with associative processing.\nWhen all sounds were compared, those made by death whistles were categorized in their own group, one close to alarm sounds such as horn, sirens and firearms as well as near human noises of fear, pain, anger and sad voices.\nHuman sacrifice with original skull whistle (enlarged in red box) as discovered 1987–89 at the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl temple in Mexico City. (Salvador Guillien Arroyo/Proyecto Tlatelolco 1987–2006/INAH Mexico)\nMany versions of these whistles have been found in graves that date back to between 1250 to 1521 CE. Some of them were associated with ritual burials. Given this, and their results, Frühholz and team suspect the whistles may have been designed to symbolize\nEhecatl\n, the Aztec God of Wind.\n\"[Ehecatl] traveled to the underworld to obtain the bones of previous world ages to create humankind,\" the researchers\nexplain\n.\nAlternatively, the spine-chilling skull whistles may have represented the sharp winds that pierce\nMictlan\n, the Aztec's underworld.\n\"Given both the aversive/scary and associative/symbolic sound nature as well as currently known excavation locations at ritual burial sites with human sacrifices, usage in ritual contexts seems very likely, especially in sacrificial rites and ceremonies related to the dead,\" Frühholz and team\nconclude\n.\nThis research was published in\nCommunications Psychology\n.",

    "content": "The phenomenon of biological ultraweak photon emission (UPE), that is, extremely low-intensity emission (10–10\n3\nphotons cm\n–2\ns\n–1\n) in the spectral range of 200–1000 nm, has been observed in all living systems that have been examined. Here, we report experiments that exemplify the ability of novel imaging systems to detect variations in UPE for a set of physiologically important scenarios. We use electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to capture single visible-wavelength photons with low noise and quantum efficiencies higher than 90%. Our investigation reveals significant contrast between the UPE from live vs dead mice. In plants, we observed that an increase in the temperature and injuries both caused an increase in UPE intensity. Moreover, chemical treatments modified the UPE emission characteristics of plants, particularly the application of a local anesthetic (benzocaine) to injury, which showed the highest emission among the compounds tested. As a result, UPE imaging provides the possibility of non-invasive label-free imaging of vitality in animals and the responses of plants to stress.",

It's hard not to associate scientific investigations into biological electromagnetic emissions with debunked and paranormal claims of auras and\ndischarges surrounding living organisms\n.\nWhat's more, even in theory,\nvisible wavelengths of light\nemitted by biological processes ought to be so faint that it's easily swamped by the intense shine of ambient electromagnetic waves in the environment and radiant heat generated by our metabolism, making it a challenge to accurately track across an entire body.\nStill, University of Calgary physicist Vahid Salari and his team have claimed to observe just that – an ultraweak photon emission (UPE) produced by several living animals in strong contrast with their non-living bodies, as well as in a handful of plant leaves.\nThe science behind biophotons is from a controversial idea itself. A variety of biological processes clearly generate bright displays of light in the\nform of chemiluminescence\n. And for decades the spontaneous sputtering of light waves anywhere from 200 to 1,000 nanometers in length has been recorded from less obvious reactions among a wide diversity of living cells, from\ncow heart tissue\nto\nbacterial colonies\n.\nA strong contender for the source of this radiation is the effect of various reactive oxygen species that living cells produce when troubled by stresses such as heat, poisons, pathogens, or lack of nutrients.\nGiven enough molecules of hydrogen peroxide, for example, materials like fats and proteins can undergo transformations that kick their electrons into high gear and spit out a suitably energetic photon or two as they settle back into place.\nHaving a means of remotely monitoring the stress of individual tissues in whole human or animal patients, or even among crops or bacterial samples, could provide technicians and medical specialists with a powerful, non-invasive research or diagnostics tool.\nTo determine whether the process could be scaled from isolated tissues to entire living subjects, the researchers used\nelectron-multiplying charge-coupled device\nand charge-coupled device cameras to compare the faintest of emissions from whole mice – first alive, then dead.\nFour immobilized mice were individually placed in a dark box and imaged for an hour, before being euthanized and imaged for another hour. They were warmed to body temperature even after death, to keep heat from being a variable.\nThe researchers found they could capture individual photons in the visible band of light popping out of the mouse cells before and after death. The difference in the numbers of these photons was clear, with a significant drop in UPE in the measurement period after they were euthanized.\nContrast in UPE emissions in four mice, when alive (top) and dead (bottom). (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025)\nA process carried out on thale cress (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) and dwarf umbrella tree (\nHeptapleurum arboricola\n) leaves revealed similarly bold results. Stressing the plants with physical injuries and chemical agents provided strong evidence that reactive oxygen species could in fact be behind the soft glow.\n\"Our results show that the injury parts in all leaves were significantly brighter than the uninjured parts of the leaves during all 16 hours of imaging,\" the researchers\nreport\n.\nEmissions of UPE from four umbrella tree leaves (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025).\nThe experiment encourages speculation that the faintest of ethereal glows produced by stressed cells may perhaps one day tell us whether we're in radiant health.\nThis research was published in\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters\n.",

    "content": "Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the brains of APOE4 carriers increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found that latent HSV-1 in a three-dimensional in vitro model of APOE4-heterozygous human brain tissue was reactivated in response to neuroinflammation caused by exposure to other pathogens. Because traumatic brain injury also causes neuroinflammation, we surmised that brain injury might similarly reactivate latent HSV-1. Here, we examined the effects of one or more controlled blows to our human brain model in the absence or presence of latent HSV-1 infection. After repeated, mild controlled blows, latently infected tissues showed reactivation of HSV-1; the production and accumulation of β amyloid and phosphorylated tau (which promotes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration); and activated gliosis, which is associated with destructive neuroinflammation. These effects are collectively associated with AD, dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and were increased with additional injury but were absent in mock-infected tissue. Blocking the cytokine IL-1β prevented the induction of amyloid and gliosis in latently infected monolayer cultures after scratch wounding. We thus propose that after repeated mechanical injuries to the brain, such as from direct blows to the head or jarring motions of the head, the resulting reactivation of HSV-1 in the brain may contribute to the development of AD and related diseases in some individuals.",

    "content": "Serious Head Trauma May Awaken Dormant Viruses Inside Your Body\nHealth\n13 January 2025\nBy\nCarly Cassella\n(Tewan Banditrukkanka/Shutterstock.com)\nA serious knock to the head may also deliver an insidious blow to the human immune system – a one-two punch that could reawaken dormant\nviruses\nin the body, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative disease.\nA study using\nstem cell\n'\nmini brains\n' has shown that a\nherpes simplex virus\n1 (HSV-1) infection already 'arrested' by the immune system can shake off its shackles when brain tissue is injured.\n\"We thought, what would happen if we subjected the brain tissue model to a physical disruption, something akin to a concussion?\"\nsays\nbiomedical engineer Dana Cairns from Tufts University in the US.\n\"Would HSV-1 wake up and start the process of neurodegeneration?\"\nThe answer seems to be yes. While these mini brains aren't perfect representations of a real brain, they are good models for how brain tissue might react when experiencing repeated, mild blows to a 'closed head'.\nA week after the injury, researchers noticed the formation of\nclumps\nand\ntangles of proteins\nin the brain tissue, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases like\nAlzheimer's\n.\nSome of the brain cells also showed damage in line with neuroinflammation, and there were significant increases in pro-inflammatory immune cells.\nDifferences in the distribution of phosphorylated tau in injured brain slices with an HSV-1 infection (right) and without (left). (\nCairns et al.,\nNeuroimmunology\n, 2025\n)\nTraumatic brain injuries, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), have recently emerged as a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, and preliminary research suggests\nchronic inflammation\nfrom even mild head trauma may play a part in the cumulative damage.\nHow that process plays out is not yet known, but other\nrecent studies\nhave found\nviruses\nmay play a unique role. HSV-1 is a major risk factor for neurodegeneration,\npossibly doubling the chances of developing dementia\n.\nIn a 2008 study, researchers\ndiscovered\nthe genes of HSV-1 were present in 90 percent of the protein plaques in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's patients. The majority of this viral DNA was found within the plaques.\nTo further investigate whether brain injury can reactivate an HSV-1 infection, researchers at Tufts University and Oxford University turned to isolated brain slices. In response to physical injury, those infected with latent HSV-1 secreted significantly less of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate.\nMini brains that were aged for 8 weeks fared better after injury than those aged for 4 weeks, indicating that head trauma may have more profound effects on young developing brains.\nProposed mechanism of TBI-induced reactivation of HSV-1 and resulting neurodegeneration. (\nCairns et al.,\nNeuroimmunology\n, 2025\n)\n\"Our results show that TBI causes reactivation of latent HSV-1 in our 3D brain model… and that if the injury is repeated, the damage is much greater than after a single blow,\" the team\nconcludes\n.\nWhether HSV-1 is awoken by physical damage or another pathogen, Cairns and her colleagues suspect this\nsuper common virus\nis a contributing factor in the development of dementia.\nThey\nargue\nfuture studies should \"investigate possible ways of mitigating or stopping the damage caused by head injury, such as anti-inflammatory and antiviral treatment after injury, thereby preventing HSV-1 reactivation in the brain and reducing subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease.\"\nThe study was published in\nScience Signaling\n.",

    "content": "Strong gravitational magnification enables the detection of faint background sources and allows researchers to resolve their internal structures and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars are useful in various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed ‘the Dragon arc’) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.",

    "content": "Record-Breaking Trove of Stars Seen Billions of Light-Years Away in Cosmic Dragon\nSpace\n08 January 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe Dragon Arc in Hubble's image of Abell 370.\n(NASA, ESA, and J. Lotz and the HFF Team/STScI)\nThere are limits to what we can see a\ncross the gulf of space and time separating us from the early Universe.\nLight that travels across billions of light-years emanates from sources so distant it can be challenging even to see something even as luminous as a galaxy glowing in the darkness.\nHuman endeavor has now smashed through those limits using JWST – resolving more than 40 individual stars on the outskirts of a galaxy whose light has spent almost 6.5 billion years traversing space-time to reach us.\n\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\"\nsays astrophysicist Fengwu Sun\nfrom the University of Arizona.\n\"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability. Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand\ndark matter\nin the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously.\"\nAlthough stars from distant galaxies are usually too small to see individually, we do see the occasional outlier, thanks to a quirk of space-time described by\ngeneral relativity\n.\nAround sufficiently large masses with strong gravitational fields, space-time itself curves and warps – like the mat of a trampoline warps under a bowling ball. Any light that travels through this warped space-time can become distorted, replicated, and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.\nDiagram illustrating gravitational lensing. (\nNASA, ESA & L. Calçada\n)\nThe Dragon Arc\nis a smear of light across the sky that resembles a Chinese dragon, with separate images of the same distant spiral galaxy making up its head and tail.\nThe illusion is caused by the gravitational warping of space surrounding a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell 370, located just 4 billion light-years away. Although the more distant light comes to us as a bit of a jumbled mess, astronomers are able to reverse-engineer the gravitational lensing process to see the background galaxies as they would have looked without the smearing – with the added bonus of magnification.\nBut that's not all. In the space between the galaxies in the Abell 370 cluster, a number of isolated stars drift around, alone. Each star is capable of adding an additional lensing effect of its own, a phenomenon known as microlensing.\nGravitational lenses have been used previously to resolve\nindividual stars in the distant Universe\n. Using the microlensing of rogue intracluster stars, a team led by astronomer Yoshinobu Fudamoto of Chiba University in Japan was able to resolve an unprecedented 44 individual stars in the smeared light of the Dragon Arc.\nA Hubble deep image of Abell 370. (\nNASA, ESA, and J. Lotz and the HFF Team/STScI\n)\n\"When we discovered these individual stars, we were actually looking for a background galaxy that is lensing-magnified by the galaxies in this massive cluster,\"\nSun says\n.\n\"But when we processed the data, we realized that there were what appeared to be a lot of individual star points. It was an exciting find because it was the first time we were able to see so many individual stars so far away.\"\nArmed with this information, the team found that many of the stars in the Dragon Arc are red supergiants – massive, red stars at the end of their lifespans that have puffed up as their fuel runs low. These are cooler, redder stars than those typically resolved across vast intergalactic distances, which tend to be large, bright, hot\nblue and white giants\n.\nThis information tells us just a little bit more about the evolution of galaxies very far from our own. Because red supergiant stars are cooler, they tend to be more difficult to see than the hot ones. JWST's ability to see red light has given it an edge in finding objects outside the range of other instruments.\nFurther JWST observations are expected to reveal even more stars hiding in the blurry light of the Dragon Arc, billions of light-years away.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Astronomy\n.",

    "content": "The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is strongly influenced by the uppermost magma storage depth and volatile exsolution\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n. Despite abundant evidence for an upper crustal magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n, its depth and the properties at its top have not been well constrained. New controlled-source seismic imaging illuminates a sharp reflective cap of the magma reservoir approximately 3.8 km beneath the northeastern caldera. Magma ascent to such low pressure is expected to drive volatile exsolution and potentially localized accumulation of bubbles near the top of the reservoir\n8\n,\n9\n, but this process typically remains hidden in contemporary volcanic systems. P-wave and P-to-S-wave reflections from the sharp top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir indicate that a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma fills the pore space at the cap of the approximately 3–8-km-deep low-shear-velocity layer imaged by seismic tomography\n6\n,\n7\n. The results are consistent with partial retention of bubbles exsolved from an upper crustal reservoir with ongoing magma supply from a volatile-enriched mantle source. Bubble accumulation can eventually lead to reservoir instability\n2\n,\n8\n, but the bubble volume fraction seismically estimated at the top of the reservoir today is lower than typical estimates of pre-eruptive conditions for rhyolites\n1\n,\n10\n,\n11\n, and measurements of the hydrothermal system document high fluxes of magmatic volatiles escaping to the surface\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n–\n15\n. We infer that the magma reservoir is in a stable state of efficient bubble ascent into the hydrothermal system on the basis of estimates that it is a crystal-rich (less than 30% porosity) reservoir for which dynamic modelling favours channelized bubble escape that prevents instability\n8\n.",

    "content": "Scientists Found The 'Lid' Keeping The Yellowstone Supervolcano From Erupting\nNature\n29 April 2025\nBy\nCarly Cassella\nYellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring.\n(Holger Leue/Getty Images)\nScientists in the United States have 'blown the lid off' the Yellowstone\nsupervolcano\n's mysterious underground reservoir of magma.\nA team of geologists and Earth scientists now claims to have finally found the deep magma 'cap' that keeps the volcanic system's high pressures and temperatures locked up underground.\nThe lid to this volatile Pandora's box exists between 3.5 and 4 km (2.2 and 2.5 miles) below the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera, according to new models – and it seems to be regularly letting out little belches of gas, holding an explosion at bay.\nScientists liken the effect to steady breathing, as if the volcano was in a peaceful slumber. But if enough air was restricted in the\nsupervolcano\n's 'throat', then at some point an eruptive snore could bellow forth.\nThankfully, the magma cap works sort of like a CPAP machine, keeping internal pressures relatively stable, allowing the supervolcano to sleep somewhat soundly.\n\"For decades, we've known there's magma beneath Yellowstone, but the exact depth and structure of its upper boundary has been a big question,\"\nexplains\nEarth scientist Brandon Schmandt from Rice University. \"What we've found is that this reservoir hasn't shut down – it's been sitting there for a couple million years, but it's still dynamic.\"\nToday,\nabundant evidence\nsuggests that there is a magma reservoir sitting in Earth's crust, just beneath the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera. How deep that reservoir lies and how much magma it holds, however, are still up for debate – making it challenging to predict when the supervolcano will next blow its top.\nSchmandt's co-lead author Chenglong Duan developed a new method to image Earth's crust in the Yellowstone region. The technique relies on sending seismic waves, akin to tiny earthquakes, into the ground from a vibrating truck to see how they travel through rock layers.\nAs these waves reflect back to the surface, they are collected by hundreds of seismometers. Collaborating with geophysicist Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah, the team developed an algorithm that reads through all this noisy data to create a model of layers in Earth's crust.\nIt has now provided what Duan\nsays\nare the \"first super clear images of the top of the magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera.\"\nHow a vibrator truck generates seismic waves that probe and reflect off deep crust layers. (\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n)\nAbout 3.8 kilometers below the surface, the probing seismic waves encountered a sudden boundary. They no longer appeared as though they were flowing through rock. Instead, their sluggish movements suggested they were moving through a muddy mixture of\nsupercritical fluid\nand magma between 3 and 8 kilometers deep.\nThe scientists have\ninterpreted\nthis boundary as the \"sharply defined top of the magma reservoir.\"\nBased on Schmandt and his colleagues' best-fitting models, half of this magma cap is occupied by bubbles of volatile materials. It can be considered a 'self-sealed' lid because the cap is only slightly porous. This means it lets out a small fraction of trace gases, keeping the overall pressure below relatively stable.\nBeneath the lid, the top of the magma reservoir seems to be composed mostly of supercritical water, which is heated and pressurized to a point where the line between liquid and gas blur, as well rhyolite magma, which tends to erupt explosively if given the opportunity.\nModel of the Yellowstone magma cap. (Duan et al.,\nNature\n, 2025)\nThe only thing stopping such an eruption is the gradual cooling and crystallization of sludgy material in the upper crust, which creates this minimally leaky magma cap.\n\"Given that the estimated total porosity at the top of the reservoir (approximately 14 percent) is well below typical eruptive porosities, our results align with previous assessments that this caldera-forming volcanic system is in a state of repose,\"\nconclude\nthe team.\nAs Schmandt further\nexplains\n, \"it looks like the system is efficiently venting gas through cracks and channels between mineral crystals, which makes sense to me given Yellowstone's abundant hydrothermal features emitting magmatic gases.\"\nIn other words, all that activity on the surface of the Yellowstone caldera is a comforting sign, not necessarily a concerning one.\nIn the past two million years, the Yellowstone supervolcano has flipped its lid\nthree times\nwith extremely large, explosive eruptions. When it will blow again is unknown, largely because we don't know enough about its hidden magma reservoir, or\nother geological forces\nlike moving tectonic plates, that might impact the system's volatility.\nThe good news is that\nrecent evidence\nsuggests the risk of a Yellowstone super-eruption is decreasing, which means we probably aren't due for a landscape-destroying tantrum any time soon.\nGeysers may keep\nexploding in front of tourists\n, and\nswarms of small earthquakes\nmay shake the region for periods of time, but\nstudies\ngenerally suggest the volcano is in a state of repose. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey\npredict\nthe risk of a Yellowstone super-eruption is about 0.00014 percent each year, based on the timing of previous explosions.\nYellowstone's 'breathing' magma cap brings yet another collective sigh of relief.\nThe study was published in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Understanding the sequence and timing of brain functional network development at the beginning of human life is critically important from both normative and clinical perspectives. Yet, we presently lack rigorous examination of the longitudinal emergence of human brain functional networks over the birth transition. Leveraging a large, longitudinal perinatal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set, this study models developmental trajectories of brain functional networks spanning 25 to 55 weeks of post-conceptual gestational age (GA). The final sample includes 126 fetal scans (GA = 31.36 ± 3.83 weeks) and 58 infant scans (GA = 48.17 ± 3.73 weeks) from 140 unique subjects. In this study, we document the developmental changes of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) over the birth transition, evident at both network and graph levels. We observe that growth patterns are regionally specific, with some areas showing minimal RSFC changes, while others exhibit a dramatic increase at birth. Examples with birth-triggered dramatic change include RSFC within the subcortical network, within the superior frontal network, within the occipital-cerebellum joint network, as well as the cross-hemisphere RSFC between the bilateral sensorimotor networks and between the bilateral temporal network. Our graph analysis further emphasized the subcortical network as the only region of the brain exhibiting a significant increase in local efficiency around birth, while a concomitant gradual increase was found in global efficiency in sensorimotor and parietal-frontal regions throughout the fetal to neonatal period. This work unveils fundamental aspects of early brain development and lays the foundation for future work on the influence of environmental factors on this process.",

    "content": "Brains Scans Reveal a Massive Surge of Connectivity When Babies Are Born\nHumans\n20 November 2024\nBy\nCarly Cassella\n(James Porter/Getty Images)\nAn unprecedented glimpse of the human brain as it leaves the womb and enters the outside world has revealed an explosive growth spurt.\nWithin the first few months of a newborn's life, brain scans suggest, a sudden influx of sensory information triggers the formation of billions of new neural connections that did not exist in the womb.\nPrevious studies have analyzed\nfetuses\nand\nnewborns\nseparately, but this new study considered the brains of 140 individuals on both sides of the birth transition. The dataset includes 126 prenatal scans, starting roughly 6 months post-conception, and 58 postnatal scans, in the three or so months after birth.\n\"With this one-of-the-kind longitudinal dataset, we now, for the first time, have an opportunity to investigate brain changes across birth,\" neuroscientist Lanxin Ji from New York University (NYU) told ScienceAlert.\n\"Surprisingly, there is still a major gap in our understanding of how the human brain changes during this crucial developmental phase.\"\nPrincipal investigator Moriah Thomason from NYU is a world leader in fetal\nMRI\nresearch, and she has been scanning the brains of mothers and their children for years now. Fetal MRI studies are subject to distortion and signal loss, and because researchers are measuring blood oxygen levels in the brain, this may not be a perfect picture of all the communicating neurons present.\nThat said, this is the first sizable study to look at how resting\nfunctional MR\nI activity might shift across the birth transition.\n\"Our results suggest that birth is not merely a continuation of prenatal brain growth but a distinct, transformative stage that impacts future cognitive and behavioral outcomes,\" explained Ji.\nFunctional connectivity changes post-conception. In the 140 individuals studied, birth occurred at average 38.5 weeks post-conception. (Ji et al.,\nPLOS Biology\n, 2024)\nIn the weeks following birth, models show a surge in neural connections that suggest the brain is desperately trying to process and integrate new kinds of information.\nBut not all regions are impacted the same. After leaving the womb, some brain networks blossom with particular complexity, creating lots of new neural connections.\nThat's especially true in\nprimitive subcortical regions\n, which are part of a central hub involved in basic life functions like motor control, breathing, blinking, flinching, and digestion.\nParts of the frontal lobe also show dramatic growth spurts after birth, as do several\nneural bridges\nconnecting regions on either side of the brain\n, like the bilateral sensorimotor regions, which integrate sensory information to inform\nmotor control\n.\nThe new findings support the hypothesis that in the womb, the human brain possesses basic neural networks, which busy themselves with 'local' matters. Upon birth, however, these local affairs go 'global', communicating with networks further away than ever before.\nAfter this initial surge in growth, the newborn brain gradually undergoes reorganization, to\nprune back inefficient pathways\nbetween networks and strengthen others. The result is a massive change in\nhow the brain is wired\n.\nBirth is one of the most significant events in human life, and as advancements in neuroimaging continue, scientists are getting closer to watching that moment unfold in a most crucial organ.\n\"This work lays the foundation for future work regarding the maturational timing of brain functional networks spanning the perinatal period,\" Ji told ScienceAlert.\n\"Extending from this work, one can imagine further studies examining how factors such as sex, prematurity, and prenatal adversity interact with the timing and growth patterns of children's brain network development.\"\nThe study was published in\nPLOS Biology\n.",

These findings illuminate how the brain adapts to external stimuli early in life and sets the stage for future neural development.\nneurosciencenews.com/birth-brain-co…\nBirth Spurs a Surge in Brain Connectivity - Neuroscience News\nBrain imaging of fetuses and infants reveals a rapid increase in functional brain connectivity at birth, aiding adaptation to the external world.\nhttps://neurosciencenews.com/birth-brain-connectivity-28080/\nPoints to consider:\n1 - Birth triggers rapid neural reorganization, particularly in subcortical and sensorimotor networks.\n2 - Subcortical networks increase communication efficiency, becoming critical hubs for neural information.\n3 - The study found region-specific brain growth, with some areas showing minimal change while others exhibited dramatic increases in connectivity.\n“Trajectories of human brain functional connectome maturation across the birth transition” by Lanxin Ji et al.

    "content": "Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of mouse adipocytes that negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.",

    "content": "Fat Cells Seem to Cling to The Memory of Being Obese, Study Finds\nHealth\n21 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\n(Iuliia Burmistrova/Getty Images)\nMany of us know from experience how incredibly darn hard it is to keep weight off after losing it. Even those who use the new class of weight loss drugs, such as\nsemaglutide\n, can face\nsubstantial weight regain\nafter ceasing the medication.\nA team led by researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland may have discovered why in an analysis of human tissues and experiments on mice.\nThey found mammalian fat cells keep a record of obesity in a process that regulates the expression of our genes, known as\nepigenetics\n.\nFormerly overweight mice with these epigenetic 'memories' experienced faster rebounds in weight gain when fed a fatty diet, compared to control mice that hadn't been overweight. ETH Zurich epigeneticist Laura Hinte and colleagues call this phenomenon an obesogenic memory.\n\"These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic 'yo-yo' effect often seen with dieting,\" Hinte and team\nwrite in their paper\n.\n\"Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.\"\nHinte and team's mouse experiments revealed weight loss following significant gain primes\nadipocyte fat cells\nto respond even more to future high-fat diets, contributing to this weight bounce-back. The cells aren't letting go of the 'obesity setting' in regards to how genes are being turned off and on.\nThe types of genes being regulated differently in formerly overweight mice compared to controls include an increase in the activity of genes involved in inflammation and decreased activity in genes involved in fat cell identity and functions.\nPrevious research has also noted a\nloss of identity of fat cells\nin obese mice. This \"cellular identity crisis\" may be what reduces the\nnormal functions of fat\nusually seen in healthy people in those who are obese, despite the latter having more fat to perform those functions.\nAn adipocyte (fat cell) seen under a microscope. (\njxfzsy/Canva\n)\nThe researchers also found signs of this obesogenic memory in fat cells from humans who had undergone weight loss surgeries, compared to cells from people who had non-weight-related routine elective surgeries.\nDue to limitations in epigenetically analyzing frozen human fat tissue, the team could not show a direct causal relationship in humans.\nBut overall \"these results indicate that obesity induces cellular and transcriptional (obesogenic) changes in the adipose tissue, which are not resolved following significant weight loss,\" Hinte and team\nexplain\n.\nFor\nbillions of us\n, factors outside our control, from our\nmicrobiomes\nto reliance on certain medications, resource restraints, and genetics, can make keeping off that weight incredibly tough. Now we can add epigenetics to this frustrating list.\nObesity was associated with\n4 million global deaths in 2015\n, more than two-thirds of them attributed to\nheart disease\n(the number one cause of death globally).\nObesity rates are expected to continue to rise,\nparticularly in the US\n, so the need to understand this complex issue becomes ever more pressing.\nBut until we have a way to tackle obesogenic memory, it may help to keep in mind\nother studies\nsuggest instead of focusing on the weight itself, focusing on eating healthier may have a more positive and lasting impact on our health.\nThis research was published in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "DNA storage has shown potential to transcend current silicon-based data storage technologies in storage density, longevity and energy consumption. However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000 bits on an automated platform with 350 bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems.",

    "content": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version –\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others – those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense – it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments – brain, liver, skin, etcetera – have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit. Speeding up the process, and making it accessible to non-scientists, could help DNA become a viable data storage medium.\nThe paper was published in the journal\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Electronic systems and devices operating at significant power levels demand sophisticated solutions for heat dissipation. Although materials with high thermal conductivity hold promise for exceptional thermal transport across nano- and microscale interfaces under ideal conditions, their performance often falls short by several orders of magnitude in the complex thermal interfaces typical of real-world applications. This study introduces mechanochemistry-mediated colloidal liquid metals composed of Galinstan and aluminium nitride to bridge the practice–theory disparity. These colloids demonstrate thermal resistances of between 0.42 and 0.86 mm2 K W−1 within actual thermal interfaces, outperforming leading thermal conductors by over an order of magnitude. This superior performance is attributed to the gradient heterointerface with efficient thermal transport across liquid–solid interfaces and the notable colloidal thixotropy. In practical devices, experimental results demonstrate their capacity to extract 2,760 W of heat from a 16 cm2 thermal source when coupled with microchannel cooling, and can facilitate a 65% reduction in pump electricity consumption. This advancement in thermal interface technology offers a promising solution for efficient and sustainable cooling of devices operating at kilowatt levels",

    "content": "New Thermal Material Could Slash Data Center Cooling Demands\nTech\n15 November 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Cockrell School of Engineering)\nMeeting the world's data storage demands\nis costly\n, in terms of money, energy, and environmental impact – but a new material could significantly improve the cooling of our data centers while also making our home and business electronics more energy efficient.\nCurrently, bulky and energy-intensive cooling solutions are typically deployed to chill out the hardware holding our data, adding up to\nabout 40 percent\nof overall data center energy use (around 8 terawatt-hours every year).\nThe team from the University of Texas at Austin and Sichuan University in China\nestimates\naround 13 percent of those 8 terawatt-hours could be shaved off by their new organic\nthermal interface material\n(TIM).\nThe TIM substantially boosts the rate at which heat can be taken away from active electronic components and channeled into a heatsink for air or water to carry away.\nThat in turn means a lower demand on active cooling technologies, including fans and liquid cooling.\nThermal materials aid heat dissipation by moving heat away from the electronic components. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\n\"The power consumption of cooling infrastructure for energy-intensive data centers and other large electronic systems is skyrocketing,\"\nsays\nmaterials scientist Guihua Yu, from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\"That trend isn't dissipating anytime soon, so it's critical to develop new ways, like the material we've created, for efficient and sustainable cooling of devices operating at kilowatt levels and even higher power.\"\nThe TIM developed here is a colloidal mixture of the liquid metal\ngalinstan\nand particles of\naluminum nitride\n, combined in a way that creates a gradient interface – one that helps heat pass through without any hard boundaries between the two substances.\nGalinstan and aluminum nitride were combined to make the material. (Wu et al.,\nNature Nanotechnology\n, 2024)\nIn an experimental lab test setup, the TIM was able to double the amount of heat that could be safely transferred away from every square centimeter of an electronic component, compared to a leading thermal paste – while also reducing the component's overall temperature.\nThe setup used a\ncooling pump\n, which is a common protection against overheating, and the TIM cut the energy use of the pump by 65 percent. This was only a small-scale example, but it shows the heat-transferring potential of the material.\n\"This breakthrough brings us closer to achieving the ideal performance predicted by theory, enabling more sustainable cooling solutions for high-power electronics,\"\nsays\nKai Wu, from Sichuan University.\nThe next step is to get the material working on larger systems and in a wider variety of scenarios, something the researchers are already in the process of doing by partnering up with data center providers.\nAnalysts expect data center electricity usage in 2028\nto be double\nwhat it was in 2023, driven largely by the increasing demands of\nartificial intelligence\nmodels. That presents a real energy demand problem – one that scientists are working hard to solve.\n\"Our material can enable sustainable cooling in energy-intensive applications, from data centers to aerospace, paving the way for more efficient and eco-friendly technologies,\"\nsays\nWu.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Nanotechnology\n.",

    "content": "Abstract:\nTidal disruption events (TDEs) that are spatially offset from the nuclei of their host galaxies offer a new probe of massive black hole (MBH) wanderers, binaries, triples, and recoiling MBHs. Here we present AT2024tvd, the first off-nuclear TDE identified through optical sky surveys. High-resolution imaging with the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} shows that AT2024tvd is\n0.914\n±\n0.010\n′\n′\noffset from the apparent center of its host galaxy, corresponding to a projected distance of\n0.808\n±\n0.009\nkpc at\nz\n=\n0.045\n. Chandra and VLA observations support the same conclusion for the TDE's X-ray and radio emission. AT2024tvd exhibits typical properties of nuclear TDEs, including a persistent hot UV/optical component that peaks at\nL\nb\nb\n∼\n6\n×\n10\n43\ne\nr\ng\ns\n−\n1\n, broad hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, and delayed brightening of luminous (\nL\nX\n,\np\ne\na\nk\n∼\n3\n×\n10\n43\ne\nr\ng\ns\n−\n1\n), highly variable soft X-ray emission. The MBH mass of AT2024tvd is\n10\n6\n±\n1\nM\n⊙\n, at least 10 times lower than its host galaxy's central black hole mass (\n≳\n10\n8\nM\n⊙\n). The MBH in AT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy in a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH ejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known off-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM J2150 and EP240222a), which likely involve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the parent galaxies of all three events are very massive (\n∼\n10\n10.9\nM\n⊙\n). This result aligns with expectations from cosmological simulations that the number of offset MBHs scales linearly with the host halo mass.",

    "content": "A Hidden Supermassive Black Hole Has Just Revealed Itself in Deep Space\nSpace\n12 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe tidal disruption event AT2024tvd is the bright dot offset from the center of the galaxy, which is shown in gold.\n(NASA, ESA, STScI, Yuhan Yao/UC Berkeley)\nA supermassive\nblack hole\naround a million times the mass of the Sun just gave away its position in spectacular fashion.\nWhen a passing star veered a little too close, it was torn apart in the black hole's gravitational field, releasing an enormous flare of light.\nThat flare of light, a tidal disruption event recorded by telescopes on Earth, was named AT2024tvd, and its detection revealed something very peculiar about the galaxy 600 million light-years away in which the event took place.\nThe black hole responsible, according to a team of astronomers led by Yuhan Yao of the University of California, Berkeley, is a wanderer, untethered from the nucleus of a galaxy. It is not even in a binary orbit with the supermassive black hole that\nis\nat the heart of the host galaxy.\n\"AT2024tvd is the first offset tidal disruption event (TDE) captured by optical sky surveys, and it opens up the entire possibility of uncovering this elusive population of wandering\nblack holes\nwith future sky surveys,\"\nYao says\n.\n\"Right now, theorists haven't given much attention to offset TDEs. I think this discovery will motivate scientists to look for more examples of this type of event.\"\nAn illustration of the progression of the tidal disruption event AT2024tvd. (\nNASA, ESA, STScI, Ralf Crawford\n)\nBlack holes, when they're just lurking around in space, are very difficult to spot, especially in other galaxies. They don't emit any radiation we can currently detect, and that's our main tool for studying the cosmos. We can detect black hole pairs by way of\ngravitational waves\nwhen they smack into each other, but a lone black hole doing nothing is invisible.\nThere's an exception. When something gets close enough, the powerful tidal forces within the black hole's gravity field will rip it apart, and send it spiraling down beyond the event horizon. This process, known as a tidal disruption, emits a blazing flare of light across the electromagnetic spectrum that we can detect from millions to billions of light-years away, and deconstruct to learn about the black hole responsible.\nAT2024tvd was just such a flare, first detected on 25 August 2024 by the\nZwicky Transient Facility\n, a wide-field sky survey designed to pick up transient events like supernovae and TDEs. Astronomers rapidly followed up, using radio, optical, and X-ray telescopes to capture as much of the event's light as possible.\nAT2024tvd and its host galaxy. The TDE is shown in blue, and the galactic center in yellow. (Yao et al., arXiv, 2025)\nYao and colleagues were able to trace the event to a point in the sky 600 light-years away, where, conveniently, a large galaxy can also be found. But, although their analysis revealed a supermassive black hole as the culprit for the TDE with a mass between 100,000 and 10 million Suns, the point in the galaxy from which the flare originated was not the galactic center.\nThis is really interesting. Supermassive black holes are usually found sitting in the centers of galaxies – the gravitational hub around which the entire kit and kaboodle revolves. AT2024tvd's host galaxy, however, already has a supermassive black hole in its center, one that's around 100 million solar masses.\nNow, there are galactic centers that have\ntwo\nor\nmore\nsupermassive black holes, locked in a gravitational dance that will one day\nsee them merge\nto form one even huger black hole.\nHowever, the two supermassive black holes in the galaxy in question are not gravitationally bound in a binary. They're separated by a distance of around 2,600 light-years, and the smaller one is just moseying about the galactic bulge.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nGalaxies gain extra supermassive black holes when they collide with other galaxies; over time, the two supermassive black holes at their hearts find each other, which is when we see them locked together as a system.\nThe presence of a second supermassive black hole in this particular galaxy means that, at some point in its past, it\nmerged with another galaxy\n.\nWhat we don't know is whether it's on its way into or out of the galactic center. It's entirely possible that the center already hosts a binary. If this is the case, then the third black hole may have once been among them, and was booted out by a three-body interaction.\nOr we could just have caught it on an inbound trajectory on its way to the center, where it will enter a binary interaction with the black hole already therein. Either scenario is possible.\nOne way to learn more about this black hole configuration is to find more galaxies that have similarly offset\nrogue supermassive black holes\n. This research, the team says, offers a potential pathway to do so.\n\"Tidal disruption events hold great promise for illuminating the presence of massive black holes that we would otherwise not be able to detect,\"\nsays astronomer Ryan Chornock\nof UC Berkeley. \"Theorists have predicted that a population of massive black holes located away from the centers of galaxies must exist, but now we can use TDEs to find them.\"\nThe research has been accepted into\nThe Astrophysical Journal Letters\n, and is\navailable on arXiv\n.",

    "content": "Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed an unexpected abundance of massive-galaxy candidates in the early Universe, extending further in redshift and to lower luminosity than what had previously been found by submillimetre surveys. These JWST candidates have been interpreted as challenging the Λ cold dark-matter cosmology (where Λ is the cosmological constant), but, so far, these studies have mostly relied on only rest-frame ultraviolet data and have lacked spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts. Here we report a systematic study of 36 massive dust-obscured galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 5 and 9 from the JWST FRESCO survey. We find no tension with the Λ cold dark-matter model in our sample. However, three ultra-massive galaxies (logM★/M⊙ ≳ 11.0, where M★ is the stellar mass and M⊙ is the mass of the Sun) require an exceptional fraction of 50 per cent of baryons converted into stars—two to three times higher than the most efficient galaxies at later epochs. The contribution from an active galactic nucleus is unlikely because of their extended emission. Ultra-massive galaxies account for as much as 17 per cent of the total cosmic star-formation-rate density at redshifts between about five and six.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover Monster Galaxies Lurking in The Early Universe\nSpace\n19 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nA composite image showing JWST's observations of the three 'Red Monster' galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn.\n(NASA/CSA/ESA, M. Xiao & P. A. Oesch/University of Geneva, G. Brammer/Niels Bohr Institute, Dawn JWST Archive)\nIn the early Universe, long before they should have had time to grow, astronomers have found what they're calling 'red monsters': three large galaxies, almost as big as the Milky Way.\nIt's a challenging discovery for several reasons – not least of which is the contradiction it poses to our understanding of how galaxies formed, back when time and space were mewling newborns in the void.\n\"The question of 'impossibly' massive galaxies shortly after the\nBig Bang\nhas vexed astronomers ever since the first images of the James Webb Space Telescope,\"\nsays astronomer Ivo Labbé\nof Swinburne University of Technology.\n\"This is akin to finding a toddler weighing 100 kilograms. JWST has now proven monsters do roam the early Universe.\"\nBased on careful observation and analysis, we have a pretty good idea about how many cosmic processes unfold. But one crucial time period eludes us: the early Universe, known as the Cosmic Dawn, the first billion years following the Big Bang.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nWe have some ideas about how fast the Universe assembled itself from the primordial plasma that permeated the early cosmos, but observational evidence has been a little harder to obtain. With the advent of JWST, we've been able to collect that evidence. As the far reaches of space recede, the light from objects within is stretched to the infrared wavelengths with which the powerful space telescope views the Universe, giving us the strongest probe yet for the Cosmic Dawn.\nAccording to our models, galaxies take some time to assemble and grow. We're not entirely sure of the particulars, but the most popular model involves blobs of\ndark matter\n, into which baryonic (or normal) matter is gravitationally collected. As more and more baryonic matter accumulates, it starts to coalesce into stars, swirling around a giant\nblack hole\nin the galactic center.\nAlthough galaxies appear pretty quickly after the Big Bang, the rate at which they grow was thought too slow for massive galaxies to emerge during the Cosmic Dawn. So, when JWST turned its\ngolden eye\ntowards the early Universe, and started seeing signs of larger-than-expected galaxies there, astronomers and cosmologists were perplexed.\nOne potential explanation offered earlier this year is that those over-large galaxies\nare not as big as they look\n; the light emitted from material around their central\nblack holes\nis just very bright, making the galaxies appear bigger than they are. And a recent discovery revealed that black holes can, for brief periods, illuminate their galaxies to\nvery high brightness\n.\nThis may be the case for some of the galaxies. But the new research, led by astronomer Mengyuan Xiao of the University of Geneva in Switzerland, shows that, in at least some cases, when it looks like a massive galaxy and quacks like a massive galaxy, it is indeed a massive galaxy.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nThe observations were conducted for JWST's\nFRESCO program\n, an international collaboration to obtain accurate distance and mass measurements for galaxies in the early Universe. Most of the galaxies the team studied fit the existing models for galaxy evolution, but three really stood out as abnormal.\nEach of these red monsters was nearly the size of the Milky Way. None of them actually contradicts the current cosmological model, nor the leading theory for dark matter; but they do suggest that the galaxies are converting baryonic matter\ninto stars\nat a rate two to three times higher than the most efficient star-forming galaxies later in more recent epochs of the Universe.\nBut the galaxies do challenge our understanding of the rate at which stars can form. If a galaxy is very active, it should contain a high rate of\nfeedback\n– forces that push star-forming material away, limiting the rate at which new stars can form. So, unsurprisingly it appears that there is something that we don't know.\n\"Current models fail to explain how it is possible star formation is so super-efficient, very early in the Universe,\"\nLabbé says\n.\n\"The usual assumption is that exploding stars and supermassive black holes kill star formation, blowing out the candle. No doubt future Webb observations will provide us clues as to what we are missing.\"\nThe team's findings have been published in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Quantum error correction provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of  when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of . Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or  cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.",

    "content": "Google's New Chip Could Crack One of Quantum Computing's Biggest Problems\nTech\n11 December 2024\nBy\nDavid Nield\nGoogle's new quantum chip Willow.\n(Google)\nIn spite of\nthe advances made\ntowards making\nquantum computers\npractical, qubit-based systems remain unstable and highly vulnerable to errors, something Google may have taken a major step towards fixing.\nThrough a newly unveiled quantum chip called Willow, Google engineers have passed a significant milestone in error handling. Specifically, they've been able to keep a single logical qubit stable enough so errors occur maybe once every hour, which is a vast improvement on previous setups that failed every few seconds.\nQubits\nare the basic building blocks of quantum information. Unlike the bits of classic computing, which can store a 1 or a 0, these qubits can store a 1, a 0, or a superposition of both. The combination is a powerful tool in designing algorithms that can crunch problems that would take a classical computer far too long to solve, if they could manage it at all.\nError levels were tracked in logical qubits (3×3, 5×5, and 7×7), physical qubits, and compared with Google's previous quantum chip Sycamore. (Google AI)\nUnfortunately qubits are delicate things, their superpositions prone to entangling with the environment and losing their mathematical properties. While today's systems are robust enough to ensure 99.9 percent reliability, practical systems need the error rate to be closer to one in a trillion.\nTo counter errors in these fragile qubits, researchers can spread a single logical qubits across a number of particles in superposition. However, this scaling only works if the extra physical qubits are correcting errors noticeably faster than they're producing them.\n\"Willow is the first processor where error-corrected qubits get exponentially better as they get bigger,\"\nwrite\nMichael Newman and Kevin Satzinger, research scientists from the Google Quantum AI team.\n\"Each time we increase our encoded qubits from a 3×3 to a 5×5 to a 7×7 lattice of physical qubits, the encoded error rate is suppressed by a factor of two.\"\nWillow\nhas 105 physical qubits\n, and a combination of its architecture and the error-correcting algorithms it uses have led to its success in terms of stability – where more qubits mean fewer errors.\nThis has been a problem since\nquantum error correction\ntechniques were first introduced in the mid-1990s. While there's still a long road ahead to fully realized\nquantum computing\n, large-scale quantum operations may at least be feasible following this approach.\n\"This demonstrates the exponential error suppression promised by quantum error correction, a nearly 30-year-old goal for quantum computing and the key element to unlocking large-scale quantum applications,\"\nwrite\nNewman and Satzinger.\nStability isn't the only benefit of Willow: Google says it's able to complete a specific quantum task in five minutes that would take one of our fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years (it's a task created specifically for\nquantum computers\n, but it still shows what's possible).\nErrors are always going to exist\nin quantum systems\n, but what researchers are aiming to do is make them infrequent enough for quantum processing to be practical. That will require better hardware, more qubits, and upgraded algorithms.\n\"Quantum error correction looks like it's working now, but there's a big gap between the one-in-a-thousand error rates of today and the one-in-a-trillion error rates needed tomorrow,\"\nwrite\nNewman and Satzinger.\nAn unedited preview version of the research has been published in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Topologically ordered phases of matter elude Landau’s symmetry-breaking theory, featuring a variety of intriguing properties such as long-range entanglement and intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Their extension to periodically driven systems gives rise to exotic new phenomena that are forbidden in thermal equilibrium. Here, we report the observation of signatures of such a phenomenon—a prethermal topologically ordered time crystal—with programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a square lattice. By periodically driving the superconducting qubits with a surface code Hamiltonian, we observe discrete time-translation symmetry breaking dynamics that is only manifested in the subharmonic temporal response of nonlocal logical operators. We further connect the observed dynamics to the underlying topological order by measuring a nonzero topological entanglement entropy and studying its subsequent dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential to explore exotic topologically ordered nonequilibrium phases of matter with noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.",

    "content": "Physicists Transformed a Quantum Computer Into a Time Crystal\nPhysics\n24 November 2024\nBy\nMike McRae\n(da-kuk/Getty Images)\nFor the first time, physicists have transformed a quantum processor into a\nstate of matter\nthat seems to defy physics, a breakthrough that could be a step toward making\nquantum computing\nmore practical.\nQuantum computers\npromise to broaden the kinds of algorithms that can be run quickly and practically, potentially speeding up research into many fields, from\nparticle physics\nto\npharmacology\nto\nmeteorology\n.\nMonumental progress has been made in developing the technology's foundations, but as the technology scales up, errors become a major obstacle.\nBy experimentally making a\nquantum\ncomputer behave like a robust form of\ntime crystal\n, a team of physicists from China and the US hope to make the technology less prone to errors as it scales.\nTime crystals are groups of particles that display repeating patterns. Where the patterns that make up regular crystals like diamond and quartz echo through 3D space, time crystals move periodically like a pendulum, tick-tocking through time.\nWhat makes them unique is their ability to do this in absence or in contrast to a driving 'push'. Time crystals oscillate in their lowest energy state to their own rhythm, like a child kicking out in their swing in defiance of their parent's repetitive nudges.\nProposed by renowned physicist\nFrank Wilczek in 2012\n, the idea of time crystals initially received its fair share of doubters.\nSince then,\na number of systems\nwith\ntime-crystal-like behaviors\nhave been demonstrated experimentally, providing engineers with a proven new tool to measure and shape the world, and a potential solution to an accuracy problem in quantum computing.\nWhere typical computing is restricted to logic built using binary figures represented by 1s and 0s, quantum computing's 'qubits' are better suited to unique kinds of computation, allowing for complex algorithms to be solved in a single step.\nA qubit is a blur of possibility, not unlike a clear card table before the dealer reveals a suit as red or black. Just as a card counter can use the odds in their favor, quantum computing uses a qubit's in-built potential to conduct calculations. Combining qubits by entangling their fates builds a bigger deck, tweaking the odds in ever more useful ways.\nUnfortunately, qubits can entangle with just about anything in their environment, randomly shuffling in new cards and throwing the program off their game. Expanding the deck of qubits to the\nthousands required\ndramatically increases the likelihood of\nunwanted noise creeping in\n.\nTime crystals have been\nproposed as means\nof reducing quantum errors previously, though pushing beyond theory into a practical application has proven challenging.\nOne type of time crystal described as 'topological' has an advantage over the others. While isolated oscillations can exhibit time crystal characteristics within a specific zone of particles repeating in space, a\ntopological time crystal\ndisplays the pendulum swing as a bulk feature of a more general system, all thanks to that very same phenomenon of quantum\nentanglement\n.\nThis generalized spread of oscillating activity is less prone to local interference, keeping the pendulum's swing in perfect motion even as isolated areas within the system are pushed and shoved out of alignment.\nBy successfully programming a highly stable form of\nsuperconducting quantum computing\nto exhibit topological time-crystal behavior, the team found it was feasible to create a quantum system that's even less prone to interference.\nPut through its paces, the system could handle a reasonable level of simulated noise in the environment, remaining relatively stable. The experiment also reflected the potential to use similar superconducting circuits to explore the realm of non-equilibrium motion represented by time crystals.\nAs a proof-of-concept, uncanny ticking of time crystals might have an important place in the future of technology.\nThis research was published in\nNature Communications\n.",

    "content": "This article discusses a new source of sacred polyphonic music from sixteenth-century Scotland, one which had remained hidden for more than five centuries as marginalia within a printed book. Despite containing only a small amount of music, this source can tell us a great deal about cultures of written and improvised liturgical music in pre-Reformation Scotland, a time and place from which very little notated music survives. The music in this source has no text, title, or attribution. However, we reveal the identity of the music as the tenor part of a faburden on the Office hymn Cultor Dei memento and we determine that it was most likely written down in Aberdeenshire, in the north-east of Scotland. Finally, by analysing the book’s non-musical annotations, we explore a series of likely owners of the book—and what it might have meant to own such an object—during the turbulent period in Scotland from the early sixteenth century to the late seventeenth.",

    "content": "Lost Musical Fragment From 500 Years Ago Can Finally Be Heard Again\nHumans\n11 January 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(National Library of Scotland/CC-BY-4.0)\nMusic has the power to transport us to other times and places, whether it's\nthe neighborhood we grew up in\nor a moment\nlong lost to prehistory\n. Researchers have now analyzed a 55-note snippet of sheet music from 16th century Scotland, recreating a sound associated with a culture for which no other music has survived.\nThe notation was found in the margins of a page attached to a book that's of historical importance in its own right: the\nAberdeen Breviary of 1510\n. The collection of prayers, readings, and hymns is not on the bestseller lists now, but was the first full-length tome to be printed in Scotland.\nA team from KU Leuven in Belgium and the University of Edinburgh in the UK have now analyzed the musical fragment, which had been discovered in the book back in 2011.\nThough the fragment has been matched with a little-known Christian chant still sung in some Anglican churches during Lent today called\nCultor Dei, memento\n(\"Servant of God, remember\"), the researchers aren't sure if the notes were intended to guide instruments or a choir.\nNonetheless, the scrap of notation is enough for experts to expand their knowledge on pre-Reformation liturgical culture in Scotland.\nThe recovered musical fragment. (National Library of Scotland/CC-BY-4.0)\n\"From just one line of music scrawled on a blank page, we can hear a hymn that had lain silent for nearly five centuries, a small but precious artifact of Scotland's musical and religious traditions,\"\nsays\nmusicologist David Coney, from the University of Edinburgh.\n\"The fact that our tenor part is a harmony to a well-known melody means we can reconstruct the other missing parts.\"\nThe music came without any kind of title or attribution attached to it, but the researchers recognized it as a polyphonic composition on two lines: a type of music where multiple melodies are sung or played at the same time.\nThat then led to\nCultor Dei, memento\n. The notation aligns perfectly with the tenor part of a vocal harmonization of the hymn. You can hear what a sung version of the notation may have sounded like in a reconstruction posted\nhere\n.\nIt's one of very few musical records we have from this period of time, and the only one that's survived from northeast Scotland, making it a crucial new finding for scholars of this period of music.\n\"For a long time, it was thought that pre-Reformation Scotland was a barren wasteland when it comes to sacred music,\"\nsays\nmusicologist James Cook, from the University of Edinburgh.\n\"Our work demonstrates that, despite the upheavals of the Reformation which destroyed much of the more obvious evidence of it, there was a strong tradition of high-quality music-making in Scotland's cathedrals, churches and chapels, just as anywhere else in Europe.\"\nThe study also investigated the history of the book's ownership and creation, finding connections to Aberdeen Cathedral and St Mary's Chapel in\nRattray\nin Aberdeenshire but no indication as to who might have written the music. The finding has encouraged the researchers to look at other similar texts for musical cues – quite possibly noted down in the margins.\n\"It may well be that further discoveries, musical or otherwise, still lie in wait in the blank pages and margins of other sixteenth-century printed books held in Scotland's libraries and archives,\"\nsays\nmusicologist Paul Newton-Jackson, from KU Leuven.\nThe research has been published in\nMusic & Letters\n.",

Sixty-six percent of the entire planet is deep ocean (≥200 m), and our data show that we have visually observed less than 0.001%, a total area approximately a tenth of the size of Belgium. Data gathered from approximately 44,000 deep-sea dives indicate that we have also seen an incredibly biased sample. Sixty-five percent of all in situ visual seafloor observations in our dataset were within 200 nm of only three countries: the United States, Japan, and New Zealand. Ninety-seven percent of all dives we compiled have been conducted by just five countries: the United States, Japan, New Zealand, France, and Germany. This small and biased sample is problematic when attempting to characterize, understand, and manage a global ocean.",

Adv.\n, 2025)\nEarth's surface is mostly deep ocean, but a new study reveals just how little we have glimpsed of the floor of our planet's largest ecosystem.\nResearchers at the non-profit Ocean Discovery League, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Boston University have now calculated how much of the seafloor we have imaged so far based on publicly available data.\nIn all the 67 years humans have been recording deep-sea dives, it seems our species has visually explored between 0.0006 and 0.001 percent of the deep seafloor.\nThat upper estimate represents just 3,823 square kilometers (1,476 square miles)\nof territory, slightly larger than the smallest US state, Rhode Island, or about a tenth the size of Belgium.\nLike the deep seafloor itself, sometimes you have to see a concept to really believe it – and that goes for numbers, too.\nLead author and deep-sea explorer Katherine Bell and her team have put together a few handy visual comparisons for their estimates.\nThe image below, for instance, shows just how much of the seafloor we have glimpsed when combined together and overlaid on a partial map of the United States.\nThe percentage of seafloor visually glimpsed by humans compared to the US east coast. (Bell et al.,\nSci. Adv.\n, 2025)\nFor those who are more familiar with Europe, this image shows the same amount of deep seafloor but laid across Belgium.\nThe total seafloor visually glimpsed by humans compared to the nation of Belgium. (Bell et al.,\nSci. Adv.\n, 2025)\n\"We have visual records of a minuscule percentage of the deep seafloor, an ecosystem encompassing 66 percent of the surface of planet Earth,\"\nwrites\nthe team of data crunchers.\nTo make matters murkier, nearly 30 percent of those visual explorations involve black-and-white, low-resolution, still images, taken before 1980.\nTo settle on their estimates, Bell and colleagues aggregated more than 43,000 records of submergence activities greater than or equal to 200 meters\n(656 feet)\n. These were either conducted within the coastlines of\nExclusive Economic Zones\n(EEZs) or the high seas.\nWhile this dataset does not include private oil and gas explorations, even if estimates are off by a full order of magnitude, that's 0.01 percent of the seafloor that has been visually imaged.\nFrom the 1960s to the 2010s, the team found that the number of deep-sea dives increased by fourfold. That shows great progress; however, over time, these explorations started to cluster near coastlines and shallower depths.\nDeep submergence activity through the decades. (Bell et al.,\nSci. Adv.\n, 2025)\nIn the 1960s, nearly 60 percent of all dives were deeper than 2,000 meters, but four decades later, only a quarter went that deep.\nWhen nearly three-quarters of the ocean lies between 2,000 and 6,000 meters below the waves, that's a significant skew.\nAnd there are other biases impacting our understanding of the deep ocean, too. In the 1960s, half of all dive activities took place in what is now the high seas, but by the 2010s that fell to just 15 percent.\nMost modern deep dives are now conducted in EEZs. In fact, of the more than 35,000 dives conducted within 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) of coastal states, over 70 percent were within the waters of only three high-income countries: the US, Japan, and New Zealand.\nThat makes more sense when you consider that 97 percent of all dives since 1958 were conducted by just five countries: the US, Japan, New Zealand, France, and Germany.\nMaximum depths of deep-sea dives between 1958 and 2024. (Bell et al.,\nSci. Adv.\n, 2025)\nIn 1961, American attorney and journalist John F. Kennedy, Jr.\ntold\nCongress that \"knowledge of the oceans is more than a matter of curiosity. Our very survival may hinge upon it.\"\nSeven decades later, those words still ring true.\n\"As we face accelerated threats to the deep ocean – from\nclimate change\nto potential mining and resource exploitation – this limited exploration of such a vast region becomes a critical problem for both science and policy,\"\nsays\nBell, founder and President of the Ocean Discovery League.\n\"We need a much better understanding of the deep ocean's ecosystems and processes to make informed decisions about resource management and conservation.\"\nEven if we increase our deep-sea explorations by more than a thousand platforms worldwide, Bell and colleagues predict it would take 100,000 years or so to visualize Earth's entire seafloor.\nSo don't hold your breath.\n\"These estimates illustrate that we need a fundamental change\nin how we explore and study the global deep ocean,\" the authors\nconclude\n.\nThe study was published in\nScience Advances\n.",

    "content": "Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons’ functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis\n1\n,\n2\n. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column\n4\n, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data\n4\n,\n7\n. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space\n8\n, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances\n9\nand bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas\n10\n,\n11\n.",

    "content": "A Tiny Piece of Mouse Brain Has Finally Been Mapped in Mindblowing Detail\nTech\n11 April 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\nA representation of a subset of more than 1,000 of the 120,000 brain cells mapped by the researchers.\n(Allen Institute)\nTrying to grasp the brain's complexity is a little like trying to comprehend\nthe vastness of space\n– it feels way beyond our scope of understanding.\nBy mapping a small part of a mouse brain down to an amazing level of detail, new research could help us grasp the magnitude of the neurological cosmos inside our heads.\nThough the volume of brain matter analyzed was barely the size of a grain of sand, the researchers still had to describe the relationships between 84,000 neurons via half a billion\nsynapse\nconnections and 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles) of neural wiring.\nThe result is the most detailed rendering of a mammalian brain on record, by some distance.\nThe incredible work took nine years to complete from start to finish, and involved more than 150 researchers and 22 institutions along the way, including representatives from Princeton University, Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.\nThe team used AI to track every neuronal wire in the study area. (Allen Institute)\n\"The brain is this biological tissue inside our heads that makes us see the world, have feelings, make decisions,\"\nsays\nneuroscientist Andreas Tolias, now at Stanford University.\n\"What is unique about this data is that it brought, in one experiment, both the structure and the function together.\"\nThat means scientists were able to see not just the layout of the wiring in the brain, but also the way those wires\ncommunicate and work\n. The mouse used in the study was shown video clips (including some from The Matrix) while moving on a treadmill, with the scientists monitoring brain activity.\nThe mouse's brain was then dissected into 28,000 separate layers. The team used a combination of AI techniques and human checks to untangle the network of\nneuronal wires\n, identify connections, then put the tangle together again.\nThis wiring diagram of the brain is known as the connectome. Scientists have previously constructed one\nfor an insect brain\n, but this is whole other level of complexity, bringing us a step closer to doing the same\nfor the human brain\n.\n\"The connectome is the beginning of the digital transformation of brain science,\"\nsays\nPrinceton University neuroscientist H. Sebastian Seung.\nThe uses for this data, which has been made publicly available, are many and far reaching. The human brain is currently way beyond even the\nbest AI models\nin terms of how quickly and efficiently it can process information, and research like this gives us a better idea why.\nIt's also a promising step forward in the study of brain diseases,\nincluding dementia\n. Digitizing some or all of the brain, and understanding exactly how it's put together, means an improved understanding of how it can go wrong.\n\"The technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\"\nsays\nSeung.\nThe research has been published in a series of papers in\nNature\n.",

    "content": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology\n1\n. The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives\n2\n. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian\n3\nand mammalian\n4\ncooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans\n5\n. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives\n6\n, but helpers also frequently assist non-kin\n7\n, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies\n7\n,\n8\n. Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings (\nLamprotornis superbus\n), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover Wild Birds Behaving Suspiciously Like Friends\nNature\n08 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nSuperb starlings have been observed helping each other out, like friends would.\n(ylsu/iNaturalist, CC BY-NC 4.0)\nThe ability to cooperate and work together is not unique to humans; indeed, it's one of the most successful strategies for collective survival in the whole tree of life, from the give-and-take between symbionts, to the kindness of strangers in the street.\nFriendship – strong and lasting social bonds between unrelated members of the same species – can be a part of that cooperative behavior. It can be pretty hard to confidently identify in non-human animals, but scientists have just discovered something that looks a heck of a lot like it in birds.\nMore than 20 years of data on superb starlings (\nLamprotornis superbus\n), analyzed by a team led by biologist Alexis Earl of Cornell University, reveals clear examples of reciprocal helping: offering assistance to unrelated members of the flock, with the expectation that the favor will be returned.\n\"This is the first real evidence of reciprocity in a cooperatively breeding bird,\" ornithologist Dustin Rubenstein of Cornell University told ScienceAlert, \"and one of the strongest pieces of evidence for reciprocity occurring outside of humans.\"\nSuperb starlings live in flocks of up to around 60 individuals. (\nHarvey Barrison/Flickr\n, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\nFor social animals that live their lives in large communities, cooperative behavior is necessary. It's common to see animals with familial ties giving each other assistance, but some animals take it a step further.\nCows, for instance, have unrelated companions whose company they\nseem to favor\n. Male dolphins may form social bonds\nbased on shared skills\n. Vampire bats demonstrate\nreciprocal food-sharing\n. And, of course, non-human primates\nforge social bonds\n. Non-familial social behavior has even been\nobserved in rooks\n.\n\"What we really have here are reciprocal social relationships,\" Rubenstein explained. \"In other words, I might help you today and you might then help me at some point in the future. Both individuals benefit from these long-term reciprocal helping relationships. Because they often occur among unrelated individuals, you might think of them as you do a friendship.\"\nIdentifying these relationships in wild animals, however, is not very easy to do. The team's work was based on observations collected on wild starlings of eastern Africa, a bird whose flocks consist of between seven and 60 members.\nThese birds are known as\ncooperative breeders\n, where non-parents help to raise the youngsters. The data, collected between 2002 and 2021, cover nine flocks and 40 breeding seasons.\nTo contextualize the observational data, the researchers also collected DNA from some of the birds to determine the genetic relationships between them.\nFrom the observational data, the researchers cataloged instances of assistance, when the birds were seen either bringing food to a nest, or helping to defend a nest. They then identified the individuals involved in the assistance.\nUnsurprisingly, most of the reciprocal helping occurred between related individuals. But reciprocal helping was by no means limited to family groups within the flock.\nAnimals that live together in groups need to be able to cooperate. (\nНиконова Вероника/iNaturalist\n, CC BY-NC 4.0)\n\"Other starlings, typically immigrants who come into the group, form these strong social relationships with unrelated individuals and reciprocate helping over time,\" Rubenstein said. \"These immigrants don't have relatives with whom they could help breed, so they have to form new social relationships upon joining the group.\"\nThis finding challenges the assumption that birds help each other with their parental responsibilities purely out of altruism due to kin selection, the researchers say. Even when relatives are available to help out, some non-related birds help each other, swapping the parent and helper roles from breeding season to breeding season.\nIn fact, Rubenstein noted, the birds even seem to form close bonds with just a few other specific individuals, suggesting that the relationships are not random, but chosen deliberately. We probably can't go so far as to call them besties – as doing so might be anthropomorphizing – but it's not entirely dissimilar, either.\n\"I think this study tells us that birds cooperate for many different reasons. Starlings need to have helpers to raise offspring. They can recruit relatives, who both benefit from the genes they share with the offspring, or they can recruit unrelated individuals by forming long-term social bonds,\" Rubenstein says.\n\"These might be considered analogous to forming a friendship.\"\nThe research has been published in\nNature\n.",

New 40Ar/39Ar dates for iddingsite within the Martian meteorite Lafayette show these minerals precipitated from liquid water at 742 ± 15 Ma (2σ). This age is the most precise constraint to date on water–rock interaction on Mars, and postdates formation of the host igneous rock by ∼580 Myr. We infer that magmatic activity most likely induced melting of local permafrost and led to alteration of the nakhlites, suggesting that activation of localised hydrological cycles on Amazonian Mars by magmatism was infrequent and transient, but not unusual.",

    "content": "This Meteorite Just Revealed an Ancient Signal of Water on Mars\nSpace\n22 November 2024\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nMost of the Lafayette meteorite is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\n(NMNH)\nEvidence is growing that Mars was once sloshy and wet, draped with lakes and oceans, which lapped at shorelines and deposited sediments that are, even as you read these words, being scrutinized by robots rolling across the now dry and dusty surface.\nWater was there. We know it was. But piecing together when and how, and where it went, is a little trickier to figure out. But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University. (\nPurdue Brand Studio\n)\nOne of the materials in question is a type of rock called\niddingsite\n, which forms from volcanic basalt in the presence of liquid water. The Lafayette Meteorite contains iddingsite, which itself fortuitously contains inclusions of argon.\nDating minerals can be a little tricky, but we've been getting much better at it as our technology advances. A technique called radiometric dating can be used on\nisotopes of argon\nto obtain a precise record of when the element formed. Argon emerges from the radioactive decay of potassium; but, when there is no potassium present, a single sample of the isotope argon-40 can still be dated.\nThis is because the amount of the lighter isotope argon-39 that emerges when argon-40 is irradiated in a nuclear reactor is dependent on the amount of potassium that was present initially. This means the argon-39 produced can be used as a proxy for potassium; and, since potassium decays at a known rate, this means that scientists can work out how long it has been since the rock formed.\nThe researchers used this technique on a small sample of the Lafayette meteorite to work out how long it had been since water and rock had interacted to create iddingsite.\nBeing ejected from Mars during an impact event, zooming through the Solar System, then falling smack into Earth through its atmosphere, being heated on the way down, can also change rocks. The researchers were able to model and account for the temperature changes experienced by the meteorite on its long journey, and determine what effect, if any, they would have had on the apparent age of the sample.\n\"The [estimated] age could have been affected by the impact that ejected the Lafayette Meteorite from Mars, the heating Lafayette experienced during the 11 million years it was floating out in space, or the heating Lafayette experienced when it fell to Earth and burned up a little bit in Earth's atmosphere,\"\nTremblay says\n.\n\"But we were able to demonstrate that none of these things affected the age of aqueous alteration in Lafayette.\"\nA sample of olivine (green) and iddingsite (brown). (\nMatt Affolter/Wikimedia Commons\n, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe findings place new constraints on the known date of moisture on Mars. The new date, the team also found, coincides with a period of heightened volcanic activity on Mars. Such activity seems much quieter now, but recent observations by the Mars InSight lander have revealed that there's a lot more\ngoing on inside the planet\nthan its\ninnocent exterior suggests\n.\nBut the results don't just have implications for our understanding of Mars. The team's techniques have broader potential for understanding the Solar System, including the open, burning question of\nhow Earth got its water\n, billions of years ago.\n\"We have demonstrated a robust way to date alteration minerals in meteorites that can be applied to other meteorites and planetary bodies to understand when liquid water might have been present,\"\nTremblay says\n.\nThe research has been published in\nGeochemical Perspectives Letters\n.",
