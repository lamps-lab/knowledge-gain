    "content": "In this Letter, we report on the experimental generation of high energy (10 GeV), ultrashort (femtosecond-duration), ultrahigh current (\n∼\n0\n.\n1\nM\nA\n), petawatt peak power electron beams in a particle accelerator. These extreme beams enable the exploration of a new frontier of high-intensity beam-light and beam-matter interactions broadly relevant across fields ranging from laboratory astrophysics to strong field quantum electrodynamics and ultrafast quantum chemistry. We demonstrate our ability to generate and control the properties of these electron beams by means of a laser-electron beam shaping technique. This experimental demonstration opens the door to on-the-fly customization of extreme beam current profiles for desired experiments and is poised to benefit a broad swath of cross-cutting applications of relativistic electron beams.",

    "content": "Record Smashing Electron Beam Delivers a Petawatt of Power in an Instant\nPhysics\n09 March 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\n(Ramberg/Getty Images)\nPhysicists at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in the US have shattered the record for most powerful beam of electrons, cramming an ultra-high current of around 100,000 amps into an instant.\nAt around five times the field strength of what could be achieved previously, the mind-blowing amount of energy in the beam's electric field at SLAC's\nFACET-II linear accelerator\ncould push the boundaries on experimentation, leading to new discoveries in everything from astrophysics to materials science.\nThe team's new technique for steering millimeter-long chains of electrons along a magnetic track allows them to squeeze the race down into a photo finish that delivers more than a petawatt of power in one million-billionth of a second.\nParticle accelerators\nhave been a vital tool for physicists for nearly a century, using oscillating electromagnetic fields to\nnudge charged particles up to velocities\nthat come within a whisker of the speed of light.\nAs the particles change direction their own field\nshines with high-energy X-ray photons\nthat can illuminate materials for high-resolution imagery.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nPlace another wall of electromagnetism in front of this beam, the energy from the colliding fields could\nshake a variety of shiny new particles\nfrom the quantum foam itself.\nTo create more intense flashes or light, or bigger collisions, more energy is needed; either by pushing the particles ever faster, or by ensuring all their energy is delivered in a shorter period of time.\nSince the electrons are already traveling at near top velocities as they surf on waves of electromagnetism, more speed isn't possible. By the same reasoning, forcing electrons at the back of the pack to press down on their accelerator and catch up to those in front isn't a solution.\nBut there is another trick. Though they're all racing at the same speed, the accelerator's electrons are distributed along the slope of an electromagnetic wave as they surf down the tunnel, with some at the 'bottom' and some at the 'top'.\nThose at the top have more energy whenever they swerve. To force those at the bottom to slow, the researchers needed a way for them to pump the brakes a touch.\nOne way commonly used to manage such a situation is the use of a\nmagnetic obstacle\nthat causes lower energy particles to take a slightly longer path, much as a chicane on an actual race track would force a less powerful car to carefully weave left and right while a car with more grunt could push straight through.\nDiagram of the FACET-II section of the linear accelerator. (\nSLAC/DoE\n)\nBy deflecting particles according to their energy level, the chain of electrons could bunch up and – in theory – pack a greater punch.\nThere's just one problem. Every swerve on the track forces the electrons to shed precious energy in the form of a high-frequency X-ray photon.\nTo help replace the lost energy, the team inserted into the middle of the chicanes a second magnetic device called an\nundulator\n, which pushed the electrons back and forth quickly in another direction. At the same time, a flash of light from a sapphire laser was introduced to control the spread of electrons.\nThe timely mix of undulations and light shaped the distribution of the chain as it was repeatedly sped up and compressed, replacing a portion of the lost energy while forcing a number of the electrons to overlap within a space barely a third of a micrometer long.\nThe end result was a powerful\nlightning\nin a bottle created with a technique that could be improved upon in future, potentially confining more high-speed electrons to an even smaller space.\nThis research was published in\nPhysical Review Letters\n.",

    "content": "A great deal of research in the neuroscience of music suggests that neural oscillations synchronize with musical stimuli. Although neural synchronization is a well-studied mechanism underpinning expectation, it has even more far-reaching implications for music. In this Perspective, we survey the literature on the neuroscience of music, including pitch, harmony, melody, tonality, rhythm, metre, groove and affect. We describe how fundamental dynamical principles based on known neural mechanisms can explain basic aspects of music perception and performance, as summarized in neural resonance theory. Building on principles such as resonance, stability, attunement and strong anticipation, we propose that people anticipate musical events not through predictive neural models, but because brain–body dynamics physically embody musical structure. The interaction of certain kinds of sounds with ongoing pattern-forming dynamics results in patterns of perception, action and coordination that we collectively experience as music. Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems. This analysis of empirical findings from the perspective of neurodynamic principles sheds new light on the neuroscience of music and what makes music powerful.",

    "content": "Music Does Something Amazing to Your Brain's Own Natural Rhythms\nHumans\n13 May 2025\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)\nEver felt like a song really resonates with you? That may be more true than you think.\nA new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.\nMusic is often thought of as a '\nuniversal language\n' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.\nAccording to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound\nso good to us\nbecause they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.\n\"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it,\"\nsays Caroline Palmer\n, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. \"That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology.\"\nIt's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.\nNeural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a\nperspective paper\nreviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.\nHuman brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)\nOne of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the\ncortex\noscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.\nHigher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.\nThis all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.\n\"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems,\" the authors\nexplain\n.\nThat's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.\nSimple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.\nOther aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to\nmove your body to music\n. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.\n\"High groove ratings\" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably,\npop music\ntends to fall right in the middle of that range.\nThe paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this\nuniversal joy\n.\n\"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two,\" the\nresearchers write\n.\n\"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health.\"\nThe perspective was published in the journal\nNature Reviews Neuroscience\n.",

This was a controversial hypothesis, as, then and still now, carbenes are believed to be incompatible with water. Although evidence such as deuterium labeling experiments and the trapping of the so-called Breslow intermediate support Breslow’s hypothesis, no spectroscopic evidence has ever been presented to prove that carbenes can exist or be generated in water. In this study, we disclose the synthesis and complete spectroscopic characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance and a single-crystal structure of a carbene that can be generated in water and isolated as a stable species, thus unambiguously validating Breslow’s visionary hypothesis.",

    "content": "Scientists Just Confirmed a 67-Year-Old Hypothesis About Vitamin B1\nPhysics\n29 April 2025\nBy\nDavid Nield\n(Petr Smagin/Getty Images)\nYou often need a lot of patience to be a scientist, and that's certainly been the case for researchers who have now found solid evidence for a hypothesis around\nvitamin B1\n(or thiamine) that was first put forward almost 70 years ago.\nIn 1958, Columbia University chemist\nRonald Breslow\nproposed that\nvitamin\nB1 performs key metabolic processes in the body by forming a molecular structure known as a\ncarbene\n.\nThe problem: carbenes are highly unstable and reactive, and usually break down instantly in water. They should, by all accounts, be incompatible with the body's high water content.\nBut researchers led by a team from the University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside) have now managed to keep a carbene intact in water for months in their lab.\nThe structure of the water-stable carbene. (Lavallo Lab/UCR)\n\"This is the first time anyone has been able to observe a stable carbene in water,\"\nsays\nchemist Vincent Lavallo, from UC Riverside. \"People thought this was a crazy idea. But it turns out, Breslow was right.\"\nKey to the breakthrough was the way the researchers were able to synthesize a \"\nsuit of armor\n\" molecule in the lab, to wrap around the carbene and keep it intact. The team was able to use\nhigh-resolution imagery\nto verify the composition of the carbene.\nThrough some other chemical tweaks on top of the protective structure, the carbene could be kept stable in water for as long as six months. It shows that carbenes can be biologically feasible, and that\nvitamin\nB1 may take on that form to do its work in the body.\nWhat's more, the researchers think that the approach they've used here could have industrial applications. Being able to stabilize carbenes could allow water to replace more toxic and dangerous substances in chemical reactions in the future, making for a cleaner way to produce things like pharmaceuticals and fuels.\n\"Water is the ideal solvent – it's abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally friendly,\"\nsays\nchemist Varun Raviprolu, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \"If we can get these powerful catalysts to work in water, that's a big step toward greener chemistry.\"\nThere's a twist here: the researchers were investigating the chemistry of reactive molecules in general, not looking to prove Breslow's hypothesis. It's another example of\nthe serendipitous scientific discoveries\nthat can sometimes come from careful research.\nThe research also acts as a reminder not to give up on a promising idea, even after almost six decades. There's plenty more to explore here for scientists – not least why the extra protection of the molecule seemed to reduce its reactivity – but Ronald Breslow would be happy to see his prediction was right.\n\"There are other reactive intermediates we've never been able to isolate, just like this one,\"\nsays\nLavallo. \"Using protective strategies like ours, we may finally be able to see them, and learn from them.\"\n\"Just 30 years ago, people thought these molecules couldn't even be made. Now we can bottle them in water. What Breslow said all those years ago – he was right.\"\nThe research has been published in\nScience Advances\n.",

    "content": "Dietary flexibility allows animals to respond adaptively to food pulses in the environment. Here we document the novel emergence of widespread hunting of California voles and carnivorous feeding behavior by California ground squirrels. Over two months in the twelfth year of a long-term study on the squirrel population, we document 74 events of juvenile and adult ground squirrels of both sexes depredating, consuming, and/or competing over vole prey. Our video footage, photographic evidence, and direct observations of marked individual squirrels provide insights into the ecological circumstances favoring behavioral flexibility in foraging associated with a decadal peak in vole abundance.

    "content": "California Squirrels Have Developed a Taste For Meat in Surprise Discovery\nNature\n19 December 2024\nBy\nIssam Ahmed, AFP\n(Luke Walsh/500px/Getty Images)\nSquirrels might look like adorable, nut-hoarding furballs, but some are ruthless predators that hunt, tear apart, and devour voles.\nThat's the startling finding of a new study published Wednesday in the\nJournal of Ethology\n– the first to document widespread carnivorous behavior in these seemingly innocent creatures.\n\"There is always something new to learn and wild animals continue to surprise us,\" lead author Jennifer E. Smith, an associate professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire told AFP.\n\"In a changing world with many technological advances, there is no replacement for direct observation of natural history, including watching the squirrels and birds that often visit our backyards.\"\nThe observations were made this summer, during the 12th year of a long-term study conducted at Briones Regional Park in Contra Costa County, California.\nBetween June and July, researchers recorded 74 interactions involving California ground squirrels and voles, with 42 percent of them involving active hunting of their fellow rodents.\nSquirrels may seem like adorable, nut-hoarding furballs, but some are ruthless predators that hunt, tear apart, and devour voles. (Sonja Wild/University of California,Davis/AFP)\nCo-author Sonja Wild, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, admitted she was initially skeptical of the reports brought to her by undergraduate students who first witnessed the behavior.\n\"I could barely believe my eyes,\" said Wild. But \"once we started looking, we saw it everywhere.\"\nIt was previously known that as many as 30 species of squirrels opportunistically consume meat, ranging from small fish to birds. However, it was unclear whether this behavior stemmed from scavenging or active predation.\nThe new study is the first to confirm that hunting is, in fact, a common behavior.\nResearchers observed squirrels crouching low to the ground before ambushing their prey, though more often, they chased voles, pounced, and delivered a neck bite followed by vigorous shaking.\nThe study also found that the squirrels' carnivorous behavior peaked during the first two weeks of July, coinciding with a surge in vole populations reported by citizen scientists on the\niNaturalist app\n.\nOther animals, such as raccoons, coyotes, and spotted hyenas, have been known to adapt their hunting strategies in response to human-induced changes in their environments.\n\"In a changing world, it can be daunting to consider all of the challenges that human presence, habitat loss, and\nclimate change\nimpose on animals,\" said Smith.\n\"Our study offers an exciting silver lining, demonstrating the incredible flexibility that some animals possess.\"\nSeveral questions still remain unanswered.\nResearchers hope to investigate how widespread hunting behavior is among squirrel species, whether it is passed down from parents to pups, and how it affects their broader ecosystems.\n©\nAgence France-Presse",

    "content": "Cable bacteria form a group of multicellular prokaryotes that enable electron transfer over centimeter-scale distances within marine and freshwater sediments. To this end, the periplasm of these filamentous bacteria contains specialized conductive fibers, which extend along the full length of each filament and incorporate a novel Ni-containing NiBiD cofactor. Currently, the cable bacteria include two recognized genera, Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema, but the genetic and morphological diversity within the clade remains underexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel cable bacteria species from an intertidal estuarine mudflat within Yaquina Bay (Oregon, USA). A clonal enrichment culture of a single strain (designated YB6) was generated, and filaments were subjected to genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization. Strain YB6 shares key physiological traits with other cable bacteria, such as long-distance electron conduction and the presence of the nickel bis(dithiolene) cofactor. At the same time, YB6 exhibits distinctive morphological features, including pronounced surface ridges that are up to three times wider than in other cable bacteria. Additionally, filaments are extensively enveloped by extracellular sheaths. Genomic analysis reveals that strain YB6 harbors metabolic pathways and genes found in both the Ca. Electrothrix and Ca. Electronema genera. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses indicate that strain YB6 represents a novel species (average nucleotide identity <95%) that forms an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade. The proposed name is Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis sp. nov., honoring the Yako’n tribe of Native Americans whose ancestral lands encompassed Yaquina Bay.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover New Bacteria That Conduct Electricity Like a Wire\nNature\n08 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nCable bacteria of the newly discovered species\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n(Oregon State University)\nA newly discovered bacterium wiggling about in the mudflats of the Oregon coast could advance a new era of bioelectric devices.\nIt's been named\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n, in honor of the First Nations\nYaqo'n\npeople local to the area it was found, and it conducts electricity just like a wire does. This is not unique, but\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nhas some fascinating traits of its own that set it apart from other conducting microbes.\nCollectively, these organisms are known as\ncable bacteria\n, and only a handful are known, split between two\ncandidate (\nCa.\n) genera that are yet to be cultured and formally described –\nCa.\nElectrothrix\nand\nCa.\nElectronema\n. They live in sedimentary environments, and arrange themselves, end-to-end, in long threads that transport electrons.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nThe purpose of this is a\ndivision of metabolic labor\nbetween individual cells in the variably oxygenated environment in which they live. It's a\ntrue collective\n, as bacterial colonies often are, but in a manner uniquely suited to their murky, soggy home.\nEven among a peculiar set of species, though,\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nstands out.\n\"This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the\nCa. Electrothrix\nclade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,\"\nsays microbiologist Cheng Li\nof Oregon State University and James Madison University.\n\"It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.\"\nLed by microbiologist Anwar Hiralal of the University of Antwerp in Belgium, the researchers isolated and studied the bacterium using genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization techniques.\nTheir results revealed that it has some morphological differences from other cable bacteria, as well as genetic similarities to both genera. Among the most important findings were the pronounced ridges, as well as the extracellular sheaths the microbes exude when they form their long, connected strands.\nA filament of\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n. (Oregon State University)\nThese strands are how the bacteria perform reduction-oxidation reactions over long distances (up to several centimeters).\nThe cells buried deeper in the sediment, where they can't access oxygen, create energy by metabolizing sulfide. This produces electrons, which they transport up to the\noxygen-rich layer\n, where\nthe upper cells use oxygen or nitrate to receive the electrons.\nThis behavior, the researchers say, is something humans could tap into for purposes such as food safety and environmental cleanup.\n\"These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments,\"\nLi says\n. \"Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.\"\nFurther work can help refine the position of this new species in the cable bacteria family tree, and what we can learn from it.\n\"Its non-conformist metabolic traits highlight the complex evolutionary dynamics within the cable bacteria clade,\"\nthe researchers write\n, \"and suggest a broader functional and ecological diversity within this clade than previously recognized.\"\nThe research has been published in\nApplied and Environmental Microbiology\n.",

    "content": "The significant reduction in body weight (BW) induced by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), such as semaglutide, has led to recent clinical trials demonstrating benefit in certain forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n1\nWhile these findings are promising for CV patients, a side-effect of GLP-1RAs use is the loss of skeletal muscle (lean BW) mass.\n2\nAlthough it is likely that the metabolic benefits from weight loss may outweigh modest sarcopenia, this loss of lean BW could potentially lead to exercise intolerance that may reduce the quality of life in individuals at risk for or with heart failure.\n3\nGiven this, intense research efforts are ongoing to try to understand how GLP-1RAs induce loss of skeletal muscle mass.\n4\nHowever, little attention has been given to the potential that other types of muscle, such as cardiac muscle, may also be lost in response to GLP-1RAs.",

    "content": "Drugs Like Ozempic May Have a Shrinking Effect on The Heart\nHealth\n22 November 2024\nBy\nCarly Cassella\nCardiac muscle cells in mice.\n(Martens et al., The Lancet, 2024)\nPopular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are showing incredible short-term benefits – from\nboosted metabolic health\nto\npain relief\nto\naddiction\nand\ncognitive health\n.\nThese are really promising initial signs, but it's important to remember the long-term side effects are still coming to light.\nRecently, some experts have\nraised\nconcerns\nthat novel weight loss drugs – known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists – could be causing significant skeletal muscle loss as well as fat loss. But there's not enough data to say for sure.\nNow, researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada have added to the discussion by bringing up a subset of muscles that only exist in the heart.\nCardiac muscles are what keep our hearts pumping blood around our bodies, and yet little research has investigated how these tissues deal with GLP-1 agonists.\nFor 21 days, researchers at Alberta administered semaglutide – the active ingredient in Ozempic – to both lean and obese mice without\ndiabetes\nor cardiac dysfunction.\nThe obese mice lost about 30 percent of their body weight and 65 percent of their fat mass compared to untreated mice.\nAmong lean mice that were treated with semaglutide, researchers noted a roughly 8 percent reduction in skeletal muscle over the course of three weeks.\nWhile there were no observed changes to heart function or the thickness of heart walls, both groups of mice treated with semaglutide showed decreases in overall heart mass and the individual size of their heart muscle cells.\n\"Together,\" the authors\nconclude\n, \"these data indicate that the reduction in cardiac size induced by semaglutide occurs independent of weight loss.\"\nTo explore further, the team of researchers, led by clinical scientist Matthew Martens, turned to human cells. In the lab, when human cardiac muscle cells were treated with semaglutide, they showed significant reductions in size.\nThe cardiomyocyte area of mice without semaglutide treatment (left) and with semaglutide treatment (right). (Martens et al.,\nThe Lancet\n, 2024)\nGiven these results, the authors admit it is tempting to speculate that semaglutide is responsible for cardiac shrinkage and atrophy. \"However,\" they\nnote\n, \"we do not observe any changes in recognized markers of atrophy.\"\nThe means they cannot be certain semaglutide is causing the atrophy of cardiac muscles, or even if this loss of muscle is a bad thing. In some cases, it could possibly confer benefits.\nNevertheless, the findings among mice and human cells\nsuggest\nthat semaglutide \"has the potential to be detrimental in the long term\" to heart muscles.\nIf the findings translate to living humans, then it means people with existing cardiovascular disease or muscle atrophy could be placing their hearts at added risk if they are prescribed semaglutide or similar drugs.\nIt's unknown whether diet or exercise can offset these potential heart muscle losses, but that is something future research should investigate, as this seems to be the case with skeletal muscle loss.\n\"We suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies,\" Martens and his colleagues at Alberta\nconclude\n.\nThe call to action is supported by another recent paper, published in a journal run by the American Heart Association, whose authors\nargue\nthe effects of GLP-1 agonists on muscle health should be studied in a \"more objective and comprehensive\" way, especially given \"the substantial numbers of patients who will likely be taking these medications well into the future.\"\nThe study was published in\nThe Lancet\n.",

    "content": "Abstract:\nPermutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move: the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the\n2\n×\n2\nslide puzzle and briefly treat the\n2\n×\n2\n×\n1\nRubik's Cube.",

    "content": "Physicists Designed a Quantum Rubik's Cube And Found The Best Way to Solve It\nPhysics\n16 April 2025\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(PawinG/Canva)\nQuantum physics already feels like a puzzle, but now scientists have made it more literal. A team of mathematicians from the University of Colorado Boulder has designed a quantum Rubik's cube, with infinite possible states and some weird new moves available to solve it.\nThe classic (and classical)\nRubik's cube\nis what's known as a permutation puzzle, which requires players to perform certain actions to rearrange one of a number of possible permutations into a 'solved' state.\nIn the case of the infamous cube, that's around\n43 quintillion possible\ncombinations of small colored blocks being sorted into six, consistently-colored faces through a series of constrained movements.\nBut a quantum Rubik's cube cranks that possibility space up to infinity. All it takes is to give the solver a new quantum action – the ability to move a piece into a quantum superposition where it is both moved and\nnot moved\nat the same time.\n\"With superpositions, the number of unique allowed states of the puzzle is infinite, unlike common permutation puzzles from toy stores,\" the researchers\nwrite in their paper\n.\nThe team tested the idea on a simple version of a permutation puzzle: a two dimensional, 2×2 grid made up of just blue and green tiles. The solved state was to place the two green tiles above the two blue ones.\nIn its classical form, the puzzle only has six possible permutations, including the solved state. Any state can be transformed into any other through a sequence of swapping vertical and horizontal tiles – swapping diagonal tiles is forbidden, as is rotating the whole puzzle.\nThis basic puzzle can be given a quantum flavor by calling the colors 'particles,' and pointing out that because each tile is indistinguishable from the other of the same color, they are in a sense entangled.\nThough the 'particles' have a quantum touch, in practice the puzzle itself is still played using classical moves. A truly quantum version opens up when superpositions between two different particles are allowed.\nThree different types of simulated players were put to work solving the puzzle from 2,000 random scrambles. A classical solver's only move was to swap two adjacent tiles. A quantum solver could only enter pairs into quantum superpositions. And a combined solver could perform either action each time.\nUnsurprisingly, the combined solver performed the best, solving the puzzle in an average of 4.77 moves. The quantum solver was next, with an average of 5.32 moves, while the classical solver came in last place with 5.88 moves on average.\nThat's not to say the realm of classical physics doesn't have its advantages though. The classical solver can actually reach the solution in fewer than five moves more often than the quantum solver. But it blows out its average because it can often take twice that long, where the quantum solver almost always finishes in eight moves or less.\nThis so-called quantum advantage should become more pronounced with more complex puzzles, the team says.\nNoah Lordi, Akira Kyle, Josh Combes.\nAfter a solver works through the permutations using their allowed moves – either classical, quantum, or both – the solution is then verified through a 'referee.'\nIf you're familiar with the old\nSchrödinger's cat\nthought experiment, you'll remember that the measurement itself causes the superposition to randomly become just one of the states. Ideally, that would be the solved state, but if not, the puzzle is scrambled again and the solver has to start over.\nThat's how the classical solver can even begin to tackle a quantum puzzle. Unless they get extremely lucky and the scrambled state is one of the six classical possibilities (out of infinite quantum options), they'll have to make moves that get them as close as possible to the solution, and hope that the measurement collapses the superposition into the solved state.\nThe six classical states of the 2×2 puzzle, with the solved state on the far left. (\nLordi et al.,\nPhysical Review A\n, 2025)\nAlthough the quantum solver seems to have the home ground advantage, it has one downside – it takes two moves for it to do a classical swap operation. That's how the classical solver gets an early head start in some versions of the puzzle, but why the combined solver always has the lead.\nThe team also went on to create a 3D version of the quantum puzzle, albeit not a full cube. It was 2x2x1 tiles, which also had infinite possibilities and could be solved through similar actions.\nIn practice, quantum permutation puzzles could potentially be built using arrays of ultracold atoms suspended in optical lattices. But mostly, it's a thought experiment for math nerds.\nThe research has been accepted for publication in the journal\nPhysical Review A\n, and is currently available on the preprint server\narXiv\n.",

    "content": "Many ancient cultures used musical tools for social and ritual procedures, with the Aztec skull whistle being a unique exemplar from postclassic Mesoamerica. Skull whistles can produce softer hiss-like but also aversive and scream-like sounds that were potentially meaningful either for sacrificial practices, mythological symbolism, or intimidating warfare of the Aztecs. However, solid psychoacoustic evidence for any theory is missing, especially how human listeners cognitively and affectively respond to skull whistle sounds. Using psychoacoustic listening and classification experiments, we show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin. Skull whistle sounds attract mental attention by affectively mimicking other aversive and startling sounds produced by nature and technology. They were psychoacoustically classified as a hybrid mix of being voice- and scream-like but also originating from technical mechanisms. Using human neuroimaging, we furthermore found that skull whistle sounds received a specific decoding of the affective significance in the neural auditory system of human listeners, accompanied by higher-order auditory cognition and symbolic evaluations in fronto-insular-parietal brain systems. Skull whistles thus seem unique sound tools with specific psycho-affective effects on listeners, and Aztec communities might have capitalized on the scary and scream-like nature of skull whistles.",

    "content": "Creepy Aztec Death Whistles Have a Strange Effect on The Human Brain\nHumans\n19 November 2024\nBy\nTessa Koumoundouros\nWhistle found clutched by sacrificial victim at the Aztec temple in Tlatelolco, Mexico City.\n(Jennysnest/Wikipedia/CC By SA 4.0)\nRanging from a threatening hiss to a blood-curdling scream,\nthe sound\nof the\nAztec death whistle\nis as creepy as the skull-like appearance of the instrument that produces it.\nBrain scans suggest the whistle's tones may do more than create a scary ambience.\nSwiss and Norwegian researchers found h\nearing them activates a variety of higher order centers in our brains, suggesting a complexity to the sound that can only be described as an alarming mix of the natural and the eerily unfamiliar.\nIt's no wonder the Aztecs likely used them to enhance\nreligious and\nsacrificial\nrituals\n.\nRumor has it the\nMesoamerican civilization\nalso used the unnerving sound to strike fear into their foes, during warfare, but\nthat has been disputed\nas no whistles have been found at battle sites or in warrior graves.\nThree original skull whistles from the collection of the Ethnological Museum in Berlin. (\nClaudia Obrocki\n)\nUniversity of Zurich neuroscientist Sascha Frühholz and colleagues recruited 70 European volunteers for psychoacoustic testing on their personal interpretations of a random selection of sounds which included tones made by the creepy whistles. The volunteers did not have forewarning that skull whistle sounds would be included, removing expectations prior to their ratings for each recording.\nThirty-two of the participants also had their brains scanned by fMRI while they heard the death whistles among a randomized mix of sounds from five different categories.\nMost of the volunteers likened the whistle\nto a scream\n.\nframeborder=\"0″ allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\"We show that skull whistle sounds are predominantly perceived as aversive and scary and as having a hybrid natural-artificial origin,\" the team\nfound\n.\nThe researchers explain the strange mix between natural and artificial makes it hard for our brains to categorize, like the\nuncanny valley effect\nin sound-form. The uncanny valley occurs similarly, when our brains can't clearly define what they're seeing as natural or artificial.\nOur brains first categorize a sensory input before using that classification to attribute value, such as likeability. But when something doesn't fall within a clear category, the ambiguity leaves us with an unnerving sensation.\nHearing the whistle's sound activated the low-order auditory cortical regions of the volunteer's brains – regions which tune into aversive sounds like screams or babies crying an\nd\ndirect the brain to analyze the stimuli on a deeper level.\n\"Skull whistle sounds are… rather ambiguous in the determination of their sound origin, which intensifies higher-order brain processing,\" the researchers\nwrite\nin their paper.\nCompared to the other tested sounds,\nwhich included some made by humans and animals, some from nature, musical sounds, and sounds made by tools,\nthe skull whistle in particular activated the inferior frontal cortex, which deals with elaborate classification processing, and the medial frontal cortex, a region involved with associative processing.\nWhen all sounds were compared, those made by death whistles were categorized in their own group, one close to alarm sounds such as horn, sirens and firearms as well as near human noises of fear, pain, anger and sad voices.\nHuman sacrifice with original skull whistle (enlarged in red box) as discovered 1987–89 at the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl temple in Mexico City. (Salvador Guillien Arroyo/Proyecto Tlatelolco 1987–2006/INAH Mexico)\nMany versions of these whistles have been found in graves that date back to between 1250 to 1521 CE. Some of them were associated with ritual burials. Given this, and their results, Frühholz and team suspect the whistles may have been designed to symbolize\nEhecatl\n, the Aztec God of Wind.\n\"[Ehecatl] traveled to the underworld to obtain the bones of previous world ages to create humankind,\" the researchers\nexplain\n.\nAlternatively, the spine-chilling skull whistles may have represented the sharp winds that pierce\nMictlan\n, the Aztec's underworld.\n\"Given both the aversive/scary and associative/symbolic sound nature as well as currently known excavation locations at ritual burial sites with human sacrifices, usage in ritual contexts seems very likely, especially in sacrificial rites and ceremonies related to the dead,\" Frühholz and team\nconclude\n.\nThis research was published in\nCommunications Psychology\n.",

    "content": "The phenomenon of biological ultraweak photon emission (UPE), that is, extremely low-intensity emission (10–10\n3\nphotons cm\n–2\ns\n–1\n) in the spectral range of 200–1000 nm, has been observed in all living systems that have been examined. Here, we report experiments that exemplify the ability of novel imaging systems to detect variations in UPE for a set of physiologically important scenarios. We use electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to capture single visible-wavelength photons with low noise and quantum efficiencies higher than 90%. Our investigation reveals significant contrast between the UPE from live vs dead mice. In plants, we observed that an increase in the temperature and injuries both caused an increase in UPE intensity. Moreover, chemical treatments modified the UPE emission characteristics of plants, particularly the application of a local anesthetic (benzocaine) to injury, which showed the highest emission among the compounds tested. As a result, UPE imaging provides the possibility of non-invasive label-free imaging of vitality in animals and the responses of plants to stress.",

    "content": "We Emit a Visible Light That Vanishes When We Die, Says Surprising New Study\nHealth\n13 May 2025\nBy\nMike McRae\nOur bodies could emit an extremely faint visible light at all times.\n(Jyoti Sangya/Getty Images)\nLife truly is radiant, according to an experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Calgary and the National Research Council of Canada.\nAn extraordinary experiment on mice and leaves from two different plant species has uncovered direct physical evidence of an eerie 'biophoton' phenomenon ceasing on death, suggesting all living things – including humans – could literally glow with health, until we don't.\nThe findings might seem a little fringe at first glance. It's hard not to associate scientific investigations into biological electromagnetic emissions with debunked and paranormal claims of auras and\ndischarges surrounding living organisms\n.\nWhat's more, even in theory,\nvisible wavelengths of light\nemitted by biological processes ought to be so faint that it's easily swamped by the intense shine of ambient electromagnetic waves in the environment and radiant heat generated by our metabolism, making it a challenge to accurately track across an entire body.\nStill, University of Calgary physicist Vahid Salari and his team have claimed to observe just that – an ultraweak photon emission (UPE) produced by several living animals in strong contrast with their non-living bodies, as well as in a handful of plant leaves.\nThe science behind biophotons is from a controversial idea itself. A variety of biological processes clearly generate bright displays of light in the\nform of chemiluminescence\n. And for decades the spontaneous sputtering of light waves anywhere from 200 to 1,000 nanometers in length has been recorded from less obvious reactions among a wide diversity of living cells, from\ncow heart tissue\nto\nbacterial colonies\n.\nA strong contender for the source of this radiation is the effect of various reactive oxygen species that living cells produce when troubled by stresses such as heat, poisons, pathogens, or lack of nutrients.\nGiven enough molecules of hydrogen peroxide, for example, materials like fats and proteins can undergo transformations that kick their electrons into high gear and spit out a suitably energetic photon or two as they settle back into place.\nHaving a means of remotely monitoring the stress of individual tissues in whole human or animal patients, or even among crops or bacterial samples, could provide technicians and medical specialists with a powerful, non-invasive research or diagnostics tool.\nTo determine whether the process could be scaled from isolated tissues to entire living subjects, the researchers used\nelectron-multiplying charge-coupled device\nand charge-coupled device cameras to compare the faintest of emissions from whole mice – first alive, then dead.\nFour immobilized mice were individually placed in a dark box and imaged for an hour, before being euthanized and imaged for another hour. They were warmed to body temperature even after death, to keep heat from being a variable.\nThe researchers found they could capture individual photons in the visible band of light popping out of the mouse cells before and after death. The difference in the numbers of these photons was clear, with a significant drop in UPE in the measurement period after they were euthanized.\nContrast in UPE emissions in four mice, when alive (top) and dead (bottom). (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025)\nA process carried out on thale cress (\nArabidopsis thaliana\n) and dwarf umbrella tree (\nHeptapleurum arboricola\n) leaves revealed similarly bold results. Stressing the plants with physical injuries and chemical agents provided strong evidence that reactive oxygen species could in fact be behind the soft glow.\n\"Our results show that the injury parts in all leaves were significantly brighter than the uninjured parts of the leaves during all 16 hours of imaging,\" the researchers\nreport\n.\nEmissions of UPE from four umbrella tree leaves (Salari et al.,\nJ. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n, 2025).\nThe experiment encourages speculation that the faintest of ethereal glows produced by stressed cells may perhaps one day tell us whether we're in radiant health.\nThis research was published in\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters\n.",

    "content": "Strong gravitational magnification enables the detection of faint background sources and allows researchers to resolve their internal structures and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars are useful in various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed ‘the Dragon arc’) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.",

    "content": "Record-Breaking Trove of Stars Seen Billions of Light-Years Away in Cosmic Dragon\nSpace\n08 January 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe Dragon Arc in Hubble's image of Abell 370.\n(NASA, ESA, and J. Lotz and the HFF Team/STScI)\nThere are limits to what we can see a\ncross the gulf of space and time separating us from the early Universe.\nLight that travels across billions of light-years emanates from sources so distant it can be challenging even to see something even as luminous as a galaxy glowing in the darkness.\nHuman endeavor has now smashed through those limits using JWST – resolving more than 40 individual stars on the outskirts of a galaxy whose light has spent almost 6.5 billion years traversing space-time to reach us.\n\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\"\nsays astrophysicist Fengwu Sun\nfrom the University of Arizona.\n\"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability. Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand\ndark matter\nin the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously.\"\nAlthough stars from distant galaxies are usually too small to see individually, we do see the occasional outlier, thanks to a quirk of space-time described by\ngeneral relativity\n.\nAround sufficiently large masses with strong gravitational fields, space-time itself curves and warps – like the mat of a trampoline warps under a bowling ball. Any light that travels through this warped space-time can become distorted, replicated, and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.\nDiagram illustrating gravitational lensing. (\nNASA, ESA & L. Calçada\n)\nThe Dragon Arc\nis a smear of light across the sky that resembles a Chinese dragon, with separate images of the same distant spiral galaxy making up its head and tail.\nThe illusion is caused by the gravitational warping of space surrounding a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell 370, located just 4 billion light-years away. Although the more distant light comes to us as a bit of a jumbled mess, astronomers are able to reverse-engineer the gravitational lensing process to see the background galaxies as they would have looked without the smearing – with the added bonus of magnification.\nBut that's not all. In the space between the galaxies in the Abell 370 cluster, a number of isolated stars drift around, alone. Each star is capable of adding an additional lensing effect of its own, a phenomenon known as microlensing.\nGravitational lenses have been used previously to resolve\nindividual stars in the distant Universe\n. Using the microlensing of rogue intracluster stars, a team led by astronomer Yoshinobu Fudamoto of Chiba University in Japan was able to resolve an unprecedented 44 individual stars in the smeared light of the Dragon Arc.\nA Hubble deep image of Abell 370. (\nNASA, ESA, and J. Lotz and the HFF Team/STScI\n)\n\"When we discovered these individual stars, we were actually looking for a background galaxy that is lensing-magnified by the galaxies in this massive cluster,\"\nSun says\n.\n\"But when we processed the data, we realized that there were what appeared to be a lot of individual star points. It was an exciting find because it was the first time we were able to see so many individual stars so far away.\"\nArmed with this information, the team found that many of the stars in the Dragon Arc are red supergiants – massive, red stars at the end of their lifespans that have puffed up as their fuel runs low. These are cooler, redder stars than those typically resolved across vast intergalactic distances, which tend to be large, bright, hot\nblue and white giants\n.\nThis information tells us just a little bit more about the evolution of galaxies very far from our own. Because red supergiant stars are cooler, they tend to be more difficult to see than the hot ones. JWST's ability to see red light has given it an edge in finding objects outside the range of other instruments.\nFurther JWST observations are expected to reveal even more stars hiding in the blurry light of the Dragon Arc, billions of light-years away.\nThe research has been published in\nNature Astronomy\n.",

    "content": "The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is strongly influenced by the uppermost magma storage depth and volatile exsolution\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n. Despite abundant evidence for an upper crustal magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n, its depth and the properties at its top have not been well constrained. New controlled-source seismic imaging illuminates a sharp reflective cap of the magma reservoir approximately 3.8 km beneath the northeastern caldera. Magma ascent to such low pressure is expected to drive volatile exsolution and potentially localized accumulation of bubbles near the top of the reservoir\n8\n,\n9\n, but this process typically remains hidden in contemporary volcanic systems. P-wave and P-to-S-wave reflections from the sharp top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir indicate that a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma fills the pore space at the cap of the approximately 3–8-km-deep low-shear-velocity layer imaged by seismic tomography\n6\n,\n7\n. The results are consistent with partial retention of bubbles exsolved from an upper crustal reservoir with ongoing magma supply from a volatile-enriched mantle source. Bubble accumulation can eventually lead to reservoir instability\n2\n,\n8\n, but the bubble volume fraction seismically estimated at the top of the reservoir today is lower than typical estimates of pre-eruptive conditions for rhyolites\n1\n,\n10\n,\n11\n, and measurements of the hydrothermal system document high fluxes of magmatic volatiles escaping to the surface\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n–\n15\n. We infer that the magma reservoir is in a stable state of efficient bubble ascent into the hydrothermal system on the basis of estimates that it is a crystal-rich (less than 30% porosity) reservoir for which dynamic modelling favours channelized bubble escape that prevents instability\n8\n.",

    "content": "Scientists Found The 'Lid' Keeping The Yellowstone Supervolcano From Erupting\nNature\n29 April 2025\nBy\nCarly Cassella\nYellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring.\n(Holger Leue/Getty Images)\nScientists in the United States have 'blown the lid off' the Yellowstone\nsupervolcano\n's mysterious underground reservoir of magma.\nA team of geologists and Earth scientists now claims to have finally found the deep magma 'cap' that keeps the volcanic system's high pressures and temperatures locked up underground.\nThe lid to this volatile Pandora's box exists between 3.5 and 4 km (2.2 and 2.5 miles) below the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera, according to new models – and it seems to be regularly letting out little belches of gas, holding an explosion at bay.\nScientists liken the effect to steady breathing, as if the volcano was in a peaceful slumber. But if enough air was restricted in the\nsupervolcano\n's 'throat', then at some point an eruptive snore could bellow forth.\nThankfully, the magma cap works sort of like a CPAP machine, keeping internal pressures relatively stable, allowing the supervolcano to sleep somewhat soundly.\n\"For decades, we've known there's magma beneath Yellowstone, but the exact depth and structure of its upper boundary has been a big question,\"\nexplains\nEarth scientist Brandon Schmandt from Rice University. \"What we've found is that this reservoir hasn't shut down – it's been sitting there for a couple million years, but it's still dynamic.\"\nToday,\nabundant evidence\nsuggests that there is a magma reservoir sitting in Earth's crust, just beneath the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera. How deep that reservoir lies and how much magma it holds, however, are still up for debate – making it challenging to predict when the supervolcano will next blow its top.\nSchmandt's co-lead author Chenglong Duan developed a new method to image Earth's crust in the Yellowstone region. The technique relies on sending seismic waves, akin to tiny earthquakes, into the ground from a vibrating truck to see how they travel through rock layers.\nAs these waves reflect back to the surface, they are collected by hundreds of seismometers. Collaborating with geophysicist Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah, the team developed an algorithm that reads through all this noisy data to create a model of layers in Earth's crust.\nIt has now provided what Duan\nsays\nare the \"first super clear images of the top of the magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera.\"\nHow a vibrator truck generates seismic waves that probe and reflect off deep crust layers. (\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n)\nAbout 3.8 kilometers below the surface, the probing seismic waves encountered a sudden boundary. They no longer appeared as though they were flowing through rock. Instead, their sluggish movements suggested they were moving through a muddy mixture of\nsupercritical fluid\nand magma between 3 and 8 kilometers deep.\nThe scientists have\ninterpreted\nthis boundary as the \"sharply defined top of the magma reservoir.\"\nBased on Schmandt and his colleagues' best-fitting models, half of this magma cap is occupied by bubbles of volatile materials. It can be considered a 'self-sealed' lid because the cap is only slightly porous. This means it lets out a small fraction of trace gases, keeping the overall pressure below relatively stable.\nBeneath the lid, the top of the magma reservoir seems to be composed mostly of supercritical water, which is heated and pressurized to a point where the line between liquid and gas blur, as well rhyolite magma, which tends to erupt explosively if given the opportunity.\nModel of the Yellowstone magma cap. (Duan et al.,\nNature\n, 2025)\nThe only thing stopping such an eruption is the gradual cooling and crystallization of sludgy material in the upper crust, which creates this minimally leaky magma cap.\n\"Given that the estimated total porosity at the top of the reservoir (approximately 14 percent) is well below typical eruptive porosities, our results align with previous assessments that this caldera-forming volcanic system is in a state of repose,\"\nconclude\nthe team.\nAs Schmandt further\nexplains\n, \"it looks like the system is efficiently venting gas through cracks and channels between mineral crystals, which makes sense to me given Yellowstone's abundant hydrothermal features emitting magmatic gases.\"\nIn other words, all that activity on the surface of the Yellowstone caldera is a comforting sign, not necessarily a concerning one.\nIn the past two million years, the Yellowstone supervolcano has flipped its lid\nthree times\nwith extremely large, explosive eruptions. When it will blow again is unknown, largely because we don't know enough about its hidden magma reservoir, or\nother geological forces\nlike moving tectonic plates, that might impact the system's volatility.\nThe good news is that\nrecent evidence\nsuggests the risk of a Yellowstone super-eruption is decreasing, which means we probably aren't due for a landscape-destroying tantrum any time soon.\nGeysers may keep\nexploding in front of tourists\n, and\nswarms of small earthquakes\nmay shake the region for periods of time, but\nstudies\ngenerally suggest the volcano is in a state of repose. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey\npredict\nthe risk of a Yellowstone super-eruption is about 0.00014 percent each year, based on the timing of previous explosions.\nYellowstone's 'breathing' magma cap brings yet another collective sigh of relief.\nThe study was published in\nNature\n.",

Sixty-six percent of the entire planet is deep ocean (≥200 m), and our data show that we have visually observed less than 0.001%, a total area approximately a tenth of the size of Belgium. Data gathered from approximately 44,000 deep-sea dives indicate that we have also seen an incredibly biased sample. Sixty-five percent of all in situ visual seafloor observations in our dataset were within 200 nm of only three countries: the United States, Japan, and New Zealand. Ninety-seven percent of all dives we compiled have been conducted by just five countries: the United States, Japan, New Zealand, France, and Germany. This small and biased sample is problematic when attempting to characterize, understand, and manage a global ocean.",

    "content": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology\n1\n. The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives\n2\n. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian\n3\nand mammalian\n4\ncooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans\n5\n. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives\n6\n, but helpers also frequently assist non-kin\n7\n, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies\n7\n,\n8\n. Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings (\nLamprotornis superbus\n), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

    "content": "Scientists Discover Wild Birds Behaving Suspiciously Like Friends\nNature\n08 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nSuperb starlings have been observed helping each other out, like friends would.\n(ylsu/iNaturalist, CC BY-NC 4.0)\nThe ability to cooperate and work together is not unique to humans; indeed, it's one of the most successful strategies for collective survival in the whole tree of life, from the give-and-take between symbionts, to the kindness of strangers in the street.\nFriendship – strong and lasting social bonds between unrelated members of the same species – can be a part of that cooperative behavior. It can be pretty hard to confidently identify in non-human animals, but scientists have just discovered something that looks a heck of a lot like it in birds.\nMore than 20 years of data on superb starlings (\nLamprotornis superbus\n), analyzed by a team led by biologist Alexis Earl of Cornell University, reveals clear examples of reciprocal helping: offering assistance to unrelated members of the flock, with the expectation that the favor will be returned.\n\"This is the first real evidence of reciprocity in a cooperatively breeding bird,\" ornithologist Dustin Rubenstein of Cornell University told ScienceAlert, \"and one of the strongest pieces of evidence for reciprocity occurring outside of humans.\"\nSuperb starlings live in flocks of up to around 60 individuals. (\nHarvey Barrison/Flickr\n, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\nFor social animals that live their lives in large communities, cooperative behavior is necessary. It's common to see animals with familial ties giving each other assistance, but some animals take it a step further.\nCows, for instance, have unrelated companions whose company they\nseem to favor\n. Male dolphins may form social bonds\nbased on shared skills\n. Vampire bats demonstrate\nreciprocal food-sharing\n. And, of course, non-human primates\nforge social bonds\n. Non-familial social behavior has even been\nobserved in rooks\n.\n\"What we really have here are reciprocal social relationships,\" Rubenstein explained. \"In other words, I might help you today and you might then help me at some point in the future. Both individuals benefit from these long-term reciprocal helping relationships. Because they often occur among unrelated individuals, you might think of them as you do a friendship.\"\nIdentifying these relationships in wild animals, however, is not very easy to do. The team's work was based on observations collected on wild starlings of eastern Africa, a bird whose flocks consist of between seven and 60 members.\nThese birds are known as\ncooperative breeders\n, where non-parents help to raise the youngsters. The data, collected between 2002 and 2021, cover nine flocks and 40 breeding seasons.\nTo contextualize the observational data, the researchers also collected DNA from some of the birds to determine the genetic relationships between them.\nFrom the observational data, the researchers cataloged instances of assistance, when the birds were seen either bringing food to a nest, or helping to defend a nest. They then identified the individuals involved in the assistance.\nUnsurprisingly, most of the reciprocal helping occurred between related individuals. But reciprocal helping was by no means limited to family groups within the flock.\nAnimals that live together in groups need to be able to cooperate. (\nНиконова Вероника/iNaturalist\n, CC BY-NC 4.0)\n\"Other starlings, typically immigrants who come into the group, form these strong social relationships with unrelated individuals and reciprocate helping over time,\" Rubenstein said. \"These immigrants don't have relatives with whom they could help breed, so they have to form new social relationships upon joining the group.\"\nThis finding challenges the assumption that birds help each other with their parental responsibilities purely out of altruism due to kin selection, the researchers say. Even when relatives are available to help out, some non-related birds help each other, swapping the parent and helper roles from breeding season to breeding season.\nIn fact, Rubenstein noted, the birds even seem to form close bonds with just a few other specific individuals, suggesting that the relationships are not random, but chosen deliberately. We probably can't go so far as to call them besties – as doing so might be anthropomorphizing – but it's not entirely dissimilar, either.\n\"I think this study tells us that birds cooperate for many different reasons. Starlings need to have helpers to raise offspring. They can recruit relatives, who both benefit from the genes they share with the offspring, or they can recruit unrelated individuals by forming long-term social bonds,\" Rubenstein says.\n\"These might be considered analogous to forming a friendship.\"\nThe research has been published in\nNature\n.",
