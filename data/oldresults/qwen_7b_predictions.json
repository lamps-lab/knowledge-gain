However, given that the Aztec skull whistles are described as producing 'averting and scream-like sounds' that could be used for sacrificial practices, mythological symbolism, or intimidating warfare, it's most likely that they would be associated with a deity known for these attributes. Among the options provided, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war and sun, fits this description best. He was often depicted with a hummingbird on his head and was associated with sacrifice and warfare, making him a plausible candidate for the symbolism behind the skull whistles."

      "explanation": "The correct answer is B) The TIM increases the rate of heat transfer away from the components. The TIM enhances the efficiency of heat dissipation, allowing more heat to be transferred away from the electronic components. This results in a reduced need for the cooling pump to work as hard, thereby lowering its energy consumption. Option A is partially correct but does not directly address the mechanism of the reduction in pump electricity consumption. Options C and D are incorrect as the TIM does not eliminate the need for a cooling pump or decrease the power consumption of the electronic components themselves. The key improvement is in the material's ability to facilitate better heat transfer, which in turn eases the load on the cooling system."

Additionally, it reduced the energy use of cooling pumps by 65%, indicating improved overall system efficiency.

      "explanation": "The article states that new 40Ar/39Ar dates for iddingsite within the Lafayette meteorite show these minerals precipitated from liquid water at 742 \u00b1 15 Ma (2\u03c3), which means the liquid water existed on Mars approximately 742 million years ago. Since 742 million years is less than a billion years, the statement is true."
