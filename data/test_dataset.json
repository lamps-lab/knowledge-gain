Smith, an associate professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire told AFP.\n\"In a changing world with many technological advances, there is no replacement for direct observation of natural history, including watching the squirrels and birds that often visit our backyards.\"\nThe observations were made this summer, during the 12th year of a long-term study conducted at Briones Regional Park in Contra Costa County, California.\nBetween June and July, researchers recorded 74 interactions involving California ground squirrels and voles, with 42 percent of them involving active hunting of their fellow rodents.\nSquirrels may seem like adorable, nut-hoarding furballs, but some are ruthless predators that hunt, tear apart, and devour voles.

Electrothrix yaqonensis\n(Oregon State University)\nA newly discovered bacterium wiggling about in the mudflats of the Oregon coast could advance a new era of bioelectric devices.\nIt's been named\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\n, in honor of the First Nations\nYaqo'n\npeople local to the area it was found, and it conducts electricity just like a wire does. This is not unique, but\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nhas some fascinating traits of its own that set it apart from other conducting microbes.\nCollectively, these organisms are known as\ncable bacteria\n, and only a handful are known, split between two\ncandidate (\nCa.\n) genera that are yet to be cultured and formally described \u2013\nCa.\nElectrothrix\nand\nCa.\nElectronema\n. They live in sedimentary environments, and arrange themselves, end-to-end, in long threads that transport electrons.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nThe purpose of this is a\ndivision of metabolic labor\nbetween individual cells in the variably oxygenated environment in which they live. It's a\ntrue collective\n, as bacterial colonies often are, but in a manner uniquely suited to their murky, soggy home.\nEven among a peculiar set of species, though,\nCa. Electrothrix yaqonensis\nstands out.\n\"This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the\nCa. Electrothrix\nclade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,\"\nsays microbiologist Cheng Li\nof Oregon State University and James Madison University.\n\"It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.\"\nLed by microbiologist Anwar Hiralal of the University of Antwerp in Belgium, the researchers isolated and studied the bacterium using genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization techniques.\nTheir results revealed that it has some morphological differences from other cable bacteria, as well as genetic similarities to both genera. Among the most important findings were the pronounced ridges, as well as the extracellular sheaths the microbes exude when they form their long, connected strands.\nA filament of\nCa.

Highly magnified individual stars are useful in various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed \u2018the Dragon arc\u2019) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.",

Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed \u2018the Dragon arc\u2019) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.",

    "content": "Record-Breaking Trove of Stars Seen Billions of Light-Years Away in Cosmic Dragon\nSpace\n08 January 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe Dragon Arc in Hubble's image of Abell 370.\n(NASA, ESA, and J. Lotz and the HFF Team/STScI)\nThere are limits to what we can see a\ncross the gulf of space and time separating us from the early Universe.\nLight that travels across billions of light-years emanates from sources so distant it can be challenging even to see something even as luminous as a galaxy glowing in the darkness.\nHuman endeavor has now smashed through those limits using JWST \u2013 resolving more than 40 individual stars on the outskirts of a galaxy whose light has spent almost 6.5 billion years traversing space-time to reach us.\n\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\"\nsays astrophysicist Fengwu Sun\nfrom the University of Arizona.\n\"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability. Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand\ndark matter\nin the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously.\"\nAlthough stars from distant galaxies are usually too small to see individually, we do see the occasional outlier, thanks to a quirk of space-time described by\ngeneral relativity\n.\nAround sufficiently large masses with strong gravitational fields, space-time itself curves and warps \u2013 like the mat of a trampoline warps under a bowling ball. Any light that travels through this warped space-time can become distorted, replicated, and magnified, an effect known as gravitational lensing.\nDiagram illustrating gravitational lensing. (\nNASA, ESA & L. Cal\u00e7ada\n)\nThe Dragon Arc\nis a smear of light across the sky that resembles a Chinese dragon, with separate images of the same distant spiral galaxy making up its head and tail.\nThe illusion is caused by the gravitational warping of space surrounding a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell 370, located just 4 billion light-years away. Although the more distant light comes to us as a bit of a jumbled mess, astronomers are able to reverse-engineer the gravitational lensing process to see the background galaxies as they would have looked without the smearing \u2013 with the added bonus of magnification.\nBut that's not all. In the space between the galaxies in the Abell 370 cluster, a number of isolated stars drift around, alone. Each star is capable of adding an additional lensing effect of its own, a phenomenon known as microlensing.\nGravitational lenses have been used previously to resolve\nindividual stars in the distant Universe\n. Using the microlensing of rogue intracluster stars, a team led by astronomer Yoshinobu Fudamoto of Chiba University in Japan was able to resolve an unprecedented 44 individual stars in the smeared light of the Dragon Arc.\nA Hubble deep image of Abell 370.

    "content": "Scientists Found The 'Lid' Keeping The Yellowstone Supervolcano From Erupting\nNature\n29 April 2025\nBy\nCarly Cassella\nYellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring.\n(Holger Leue/Getty Images)\nScientists in the United States have 'blown the lid off' the Yellowstone\nsupervolcano\n's mysterious underground reservoir of magma.\nA team of geologists and Earth scientists now claims to have finally found the deep magma 'cap' that keeps the volcanic system's high pressures and temperatures locked up underground.\nThe lid to this volatile Pandora's box exists between 3.5 and 4 km (2.2 and 2.5 miles) below the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera, according to new models \u2013 and it seems to be regularly letting out little belches of gas, holding an explosion at bay.\nScientists liken the effect to steady breathing, as if the volcano was in a peaceful slumber. But if enough air was restricted in the\nsupervolcano\n's 'throat', then at some point an eruptive snore could bellow forth.\nThankfully, the magma cap works sort of like a CPAP machine, keeping internal pressures relatively stable, allowing the supervolcano to sleep somewhat soundly.\n\"For decades, we've known there's magma beneath Yellowstone, but the exact depth and structure of its upper boundary has been a big question,\"\nexplains\nEarth scientist Brandon Schmandt from Rice University. \"What we've found is that this reservoir hasn't shut down \u2013 it's been sitting there for a couple million years, but it's still dynamic.\"\nToday,\nabundant evidence\nsuggests that there is a magma reservoir sitting in Earth's crust, just beneath the northeastern part of the Yellowstone caldera. How deep that reservoir lies and how much magma it holds, however, are still up for debate \u2013 making it challenging to predict when the supervolcano will next blow its top.\nSchmandt's co-lead author Chenglong Duan developed a new method to image Earth's crust in the Yellowstone region. The technique relies on sending seismic waves, akin to tiny earthquakes, into the ground from a vibrating truck to see how they travel through rock layers.\nAs these waves reflect back to the surface, they are collected by hundreds of seismometers. Collaborating with geophysicist Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah, the team developed an algorithm that reads through all this noisy data to create a model of layers in Earth's crust.\nIt has now provided what Duan\nsays\nare the \"first super clear images of the top of the magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera.\"\nHow a vibrator truck generates seismic waves that probe and reflect off deep crust layers. (\nThe University of Texas at Austin\n)\nAbout 3.8 kilometers below the surface, the probing seismic waves encountered a sudden boundary. They no longer appeared as though they were flowing through rock. Instead, their sluggish movements suggested they were moving through a muddy mixture of\nsupercritical fluid\nand magma between 3 and 8 kilometers deep.\nThe scientists have\ninterpreted\nthis boundary as the \"sharply defined top of the magma reservoir.\"\nBased on Schmandt and his colleagues' best-fitting models, half of this magma cap is occupied by bubbles of volatile materials.

    "content": "A Hidden Supermassive Black Hole Has Just Revealed Itself in Deep Space\nSpace\n12 May 2025\nBy\nMichelle Starr\nThe tidal disruption event AT2024tvd is the bright dot offset from the center of the galaxy, which is shown in gold.\n(NASA, ESA, STScI, Yuhan Yao/UC Berkeley)\nA supermassive\nblack hole\naround a million times the mass of the Sun just gave away its position in spectacular fashion.\nWhen a passing star veered a little too close, it was torn apart in the black hole's gravitational field, releasing an enormous flare of light.\nThat flare of light, a tidal disruption event recorded by telescopes on Earth, was named AT2024tvd, and its detection revealed something very peculiar about the galaxy 600 million light-years away in which the event took place.\nThe black hole responsible, according to a team of astronomers led by Yuhan Yao of the University of California, Berkeley, is a wanderer, untethered from the nucleus of a galaxy. It is not even in a binary orbit with the supermassive black hole that\nis\nat the heart of the host galaxy.\n\"AT2024tvd is the first offset tidal disruption event (TDE) captured by optical sky surveys, and it opens up the entire possibility of uncovering this elusive population of wandering\nblack holes\nwith future sky surveys,\"\nYao says\n.\n\"Right now, theorists haven't given much attention to offset TDEs. I think this discovery will motivate scientists to look for more examples of this type of event.\"\nAn illustration of the progression of the tidal disruption event AT2024tvd. (\nNASA, ESA, STScI, Ralf Crawford\n)\nBlack holes, when they're just lurking around in space, are very difficult to spot, especially in other galaxies. They don't emit any radiation we can currently detect, and that's our main tool for studying the cosmos. We can detect black hole pairs by way of\ngravitational waves\nwhen they smack into each other, but a lone black hole doing nothing is invisible.\nThere's an exception. When something gets close enough, the powerful tidal forces within the black hole's gravity field will rip it apart, and send it spiraling down beyond the event horizon. This process, known as a tidal disruption, emits a blazing flare of light across the electromagnetic spectrum that we can detect from millions to billions of light-years away, and deconstruct to learn about the black hole responsible.\nAT2024tvd was just such a flare, first detected on 25 August 2024 by the\nZwicky Transient Facility\n, a wide-field sky survey designed to pick up transient events like supernovae and TDEs. Astronomers rapidly followed up, using radio, optical, and X-ray telescopes to capture as much of the event's light as possible.\nAT2024tvd and its host galaxy. The TDE is shown in blue, and the galactic center in yellow. (Yao et al., arXiv, 2025)\nYao and colleagues were able to trace the event to a point in the sky 600 light-years away, where, conveniently, a large galaxy can also be found. But, although their analysis revealed a supermassive black hole as the culprit for the TDE with a mass between 100,000 and 10 million Suns, the point in the galaxy from which the flare originated was not the galactic center.\nThis is really interesting. Supermassive black holes are usually found sitting in the centers of galaxies \u2013 the gravitational hub around which the entire kit and kaboodle revolves. AT2024tvd's host galaxy, however, already has a supermassive black hole in its center, one that's around 100 million solar masses.\nNow, there are galactic centers that have\ntwo\nor\nmore\nsupermassive black holes, locked in a gravitational dance that will one day\nsee them merge\nto form one even huger black hole.\nHowever, the two supermassive black holes in the galaxy in question are not gravitationally bound in a binary. They're separated by a distance of around 2,600 light-years, and the smaller one is just moseying about the galactic bulge.\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\nGalaxies gain extra supermassive black holes when they collide with other galaxies; over time, the two supermassive black holes at their hearts find each other, which is when we see them locked together as a system.\nThe presence of a second supermassive black hole in this particular galaxy means that, at some point in its past, it\nmerged with another galaxy\n.\nWhat we don't know is whether it's on its way into or out of the galactic center. It's entirely possible that the center already hosts a binary. If this is the case, then the third black hole may have once been among them, and was booted out by a three-body interaction.\nOr we could just have caught it on an inbound trajectory on its way to the center, where it will enter a binary interaction with the black hole already therein. Either scenario is possible.\nOne way to learn more about this black hole configuration is to find more galaxies that have similarly offset\nrogue supermassive black holes\n. This research, the team says, offers a potential pathway to do so.\n\"Tidal disruption events hold great promise for illuminating the presence of massive black holes that we would otherwise not be able to detect,\"\nsays astronomer Ryan Chornock\nof UC Berkeley. \"Theorists have predicted that a population of massive black holes located away from the centers of galaxies must exist, but now we can use TDEs to find them.\"\nThe research has been accepted into\nThe Astrophysical Journal Letters\n, and is\navailable on arXiv\n.",

    "content": "A New DNA-Printing Technique Could Revolutionize How We Store Data\nTech\n18 November 2024\nBy\nMichael Irving\n(alanphillips/Getty Images)\nAs efficient as electronic data storage systems can be, they've got nothing on nature's own version \u2013\nDNA\n. A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments \u2013 brain, liver, skin, etcetera \u2013 have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit. Speeding up the process, and making it accessible to non-scientists, could help DNA become a viable data storage medium.\nThe paper was published in the journal\nNature\n.",

A new technique for writing data to DNA works like a printing press and makes it easy enough that anyone could do it.\nWriting data to DNA usually involves synthesizing strands one letter at a time, like threading beads onto a string. That's obviously a very slow process, especially when there can be billions of those letters, or bases, in a given DNA sequence.\nBut the new\nDNA printing press\ndrastically speeds the process up. The team created a set of 700 DNA bricks, each containing 24 bases, that work like movable type pieces. These can be arranged into a desired order and then used to 'print' their data onto DNA template strands.\nRather than writing one bit at a time, this printing press speeds it up to 350 bits simultaneously, per reaction.\nTo simplify the process, data isn't encoded into the usual GCAT letters of DNA, but the familiar ones and zeroes of binary code. In this case, chemical markers were attached to some DNA bricks but not others \u2013 those with markers represented ones, and those without were the zeroes.\nThe team\ntested the technique\nby storing images, including 16,833 bits for an ancient Chinese rubbing of a tiger, and a photo of a panda made up of over 252,500 bits. After some tweaking, 100 percent of the data could be recovered using standard DNA reading methods.\nTo  show off how simple it could be to use, the team ran an\nexperiment\nwith 60 people. Participants used a software platform called iDNAdrive to encode pieces of text of their choice, totaling around 5,000 bits. Data was successfully read back with 98.58 percent accuracy.\nThe appeal of\nDNA data storage\nis clear. For one it's incredibly dense \u2013 it's been estimated that you could store more than\n10 billion gigabytes\nof data in just 1 cm\n3\nof DNA. Better yet, stored under the right conditions this data can last thousands or even\nmillions of years\n, making it a great archival system.\nReading data from DNA is relatively fast, but writing is the bottleneck. The same could be said of text in ancient times, so the researchers on the new study applied a similar solution.\nThe invention of movable type printing enabled the first mass-produced texts. Individual characters on their own little stamps could be arranged into large blocks, to print many copies quickly. The inspiration for molecular movable type came from the way our own cells store and process data.\nEvery cell in your body contains your complete genome. What differentiates cells in various tissues is an extra layer of information called the\nepigenome\n. Attached chemical markers indicate which genes need to be switched on or off to let cells perform different roles.\nTo put it another way, if your body was a company, every employee gets the same handbook, but different departments \u2013 brain, liver, skin, etcetera \u2013 have different chapters highlighted, so the cells know the specific info they need to do their jobs.\nFor the new\nDNA printing press\n, these markers, or methyl groups, hold the information being written and read back. The DNA bricks are the movable type pieces, and blank DNA template strands are the paper.\nWhen a certain sequence is needed, the corresponding bricks are selected and placed in solution with the template. Once there, the bricks bind to specific regions along the DNA template.\nFinally comes the ink. An enzyme copies all the methyl groups from the bricks onto each part of the DNA template. Later, a\nnanopore sequencing\ndevice can then read out the pattern of ones and zeroes to recreate the stored digital files.\nBecause the bricks self-assemble on the template DNA strand, lots of writing happens at once, rather than bit by bit.

But we just got a big clue: a meteorite that was ejected from Mars 11 million years ago and subsequently made its way to Earth reveals there was liquid water on Mars less than a billion years ago.\nAccording to a new analysis of the Lafayette Meteorite, minerals within it formed in the presence of water 742 million years ago. It's a real breakthrough in the dating of aqueous minerals on Mars, and suggests that, sometimes, Mars might still be a little damp.\n\"Dating these minerals can therefore tell us when there was liquid water at or near the surface of Mars in the planet's geologic past,\"\nsays geochemist Marissa Tremblay\nof Purdue University in the US.\n\"We dated these minerals in the Martian meteorite Lafayette and found that they formed 742 million years ago. We do not think there was abundant liquid water on the surface of Mars at this time. Instead, we think the water came from the melting of nearby subsurface ice called permafrost, and that the permafrost melting was caused by magmatic activity that still occurs periodically on Mars to the present day.\"\nA piece of the Lafayette meteorite at Purdue University. (\nPurdue Brand Studio\n)\nOne of the materials in question is a type of rock called\niddingsite\n, which forms from volcanic basalt in the presence of liquid water. The Lafayette Meteorite contains iddingsite, which itself fortuitously contains inclusions of argon.\nDating minerals can be a little tricky, but we've been getting much better at it as our technology advances. A technique called radiometric dating can be used on\nisotopes of argon\nto obtain a precise record of when the element formed. Argon emerges from the radioactive decay of potassium; but, when there is no potassium present, a single sample of the isotope argon-40 can still be dated.\nThis is because the amount of the lighter isotope argon-39 that emerges when argon-40 is irradiated in a nuclear reactor is dependent on the amount of potassium that was present initially. This means the argon-39 produced can be used as a proxy for potassium; and, since potassium decays at a known rate, this means that scientists can work out how long it has been since the rock formed.\nThe researchers used this technique on a small sample of the Lafayette meteorite to work out how long it had been since water and rock had interacted to create iddingsite.\nBeing ejected from Mars during an impact event, zooming through the Solar System, then falling smack into Earth through its atmosphere, being heated on the way down, can also change rocks. The researchers were able to model and account for the temperature changes experienced by the meteorite on its long journey, and determine what effect, if any, they would have had on the apparent age of the sample.\n\"The [estimated] age could have been affected by the impact that ejected the Lafayette Meteorite from Mars, the heating Lafayette experienced during the 11 million years it was floating out in space, or the heating Lafayette experienced when it fell to Earth and burned up a little bit in Earth's atmosphere,\"\nTremblay says\n.\n\"But we were able to demonstrate that none of these things affected the age of aqueous alteration in Lafayette.\"\nA sample of olivine (green) and iddingsite (brown). (\nMatt Affolter/Wikimedia Commons\n, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nThe findings place new constraints on the known date of moisture on Mars. The new date, the team also found, coincides with a period of heightened volcanic activity on Mars. Such activity seems much quieter now, but recent observations by the Mars InSight lander have revealed that there's a lot more\ngoing on inside the planet\nthan its\ninnocent exterior suggests\n.\nBut the results don't just have implications for our understanding of Mars. The team's techniques have broader potential for understanding the Solar System, including the open, burning question of\nhow Earth got its water\n, billions of years ago.\n\"We have demonstrated a robust way to date alteration minerals in meteorites that can be applied to other meteorites and planetary bodies to understand when liquid water might have been present,\"\nTremblay says\n.\nThe research has been published in\nGeochemical Perspectives Letters\n.",
